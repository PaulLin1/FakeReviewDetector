Angst-check
Hot men-check
Steamy sex-check

All of the above nicely rounds out the story of Eric and Jordan, two football players looking to finally stop playing games when it comes to love.

Eric is a hot shot quarterback that is use to getting what he wants. Jordan is the up and comer, who knows all about Eric Higgins, including his sexual preference. When these two are finally in a room together, there are nothing but fireworks. Super sexy fireworks between them.

I loved how forceful Eric came off at first, with Jordan giving back as much as he was taking. Even the banter between these two was scorching hot. Both men are on the down low while their careers are in the spotlight, however they still want to take a chance on each other.

Playing Hard was a quick sexy read that left me wanting much, much more. As I read, I knew things couldn't be this easy for two high profile football players looking to stay in the closet, and I was right. J.T. Fox gives us an excellent first book to the Hot for Him series.

It's also a thriller, and it uses a bunch of cheap tricks to achieve that. Every other page is some new dangerous life or death situation. Despite all the talk of how competent the characters are they are still thrown from one random situation to another, really they are just along for the ride their choices don't seem to matter, the author will dues ex machina as needed to keep people alive and to keep the suspense and urgency going. Also he's really light on the backstory, constantly hinting at it with characters literally saying ""ill explain everything later"" but they never do.

Frustratingly I think the setting of the book is fairly interesting, sort of a shadow run setting, except more post apocalyptic and heavier on the brain hacking/AI side.

The author's book description is so far off as to be false advertising. This is NOT a novel. This is a collection of short stories. I only read the first. If the author doesn't take the time to describe the ""freebie"" stories, I conclude the quality is too low to be worth my time. The first story supports this.

""Bearly Mended"" shows potential. He & she meet when she (a doctor) treats his wounds. What I liked best is the universe, which shows potential. The leading man's personality & behavior was well crafted. The grammar was pretty good, which is above most self published stories.

Alas, the problems are numerous. The plot is fragmented. The doctor's behavior is so unprofessional (what employer would put up with an employee just leaving mid-shift without notice?) and unrealistic (how did this doctor get avoid working in an emergency room as part of her training?) that she would be fired immediately. The lack of police involvement cannot be justified in a society where shifters are known citizens.

I really liked Micah! I didn't think his secrets were all that bad. Although he has money, he is very giving to those he cares about and he gives a lot to charity. For me Micah made the book!
Another big problem for me was, that Allie and Micah NEVER said I LOVE YOU!!! Only at the very end, did Micah say ""this is love"" and all Allie did was smile and nod!! I've never read a book before where the main characters didn't say ""I love you"" at some point in the book. I found this to be very odd!!

As I read WJ Davies' Binary Cycle: Disruption, I found myself going back to those days in junior high and high school, lying on my bed and dreaming of a world different than our own, yet similar in many ways.
The world Davies has dreamed up -- Taran -- is on the brink of disaster. A colony of a dying Earth, it has been left to itself since its founding and planetary forces are threatening its very existence. But, that's just the foundation for the story as Davies interweaves characters through various places on the planet as these disruptions are having different effects -- biological, physical, political -- and the characters are all wonderfully crafted to the delight of this reader.
I really found myself identifying with the character Jonathas as he navigated a disaster area in search of his girlfriend and the new-found technology recently implanted into his bloodstream.
The book ends on a doozy of a note and I am really looking forward to the next installment in this series from Davies.",-0.5789,51.41,1

This started out as a slightly depressing story- Atwood's wife cheats on him, his in-laws (mother/father/brother) live with them and take complete advantage of him, his job's in jeopardy. The best thing his wife could have done for him was get him hooked up with the All American Studs crew, where he's finally able to realize what makes him happy.

Trailer Park Abe is a quick read, but there's a lot packed into this short story...I was disgusted by his wife and her family, frustrated with the way they treated him and how he let himself be treated, but glad when he decided enough was enough.

Working for AAS made him open his eyes to who he really is, and that made all the difference for him. Meeting Reece was probably the best thing that could have happened to him, and I am looking forward to more of their story.

There definitely were some obvious plot twists and turns but that just added to the book's charm- it was a fluffier suspense book with plenty of fun occurrences and tame romance to really engage the reader. I liked all the characters too which was a plus.

A couple of things for me that kept it from being a five star:  the ending did not have full closure, so I am assuming that there will have to be a follow-up book(s), otherwise everything is left to the imagination. That was a bummer. Second while the book was fun and I liked all the characters, Cassie was sometimes very immature. Her actions made me cring a few times.  It also annoyed me that for a person with a degree in the fitness and health industry, she did not really know her craft.

The setting was faboulos, and considering I love that Gilded Age atmosphere, and I usually try to visit at least one of those villas each time I'm in the US, I was fascinated like Griff by the architecture, and I believe the description of the lives of who was lucky enough to grew up among those walls was spot on.

Rise of the Trinity started out really well and had a great part in the middle, but overall it left me disappointed. There were several grammatical errors and typos.

Midway through the book they have their 15th birthday. At times the reader is told in the narrative that years have passed, but the action would not indicate this.

 I don't know how I feel about this book. Don't get me wrong it was good - what I read of it anyway. I had to stop reading because for some unknown reason it made me sad. I knew something bad was going to happen. The sense of foreboding was overwhelming and I just couldn't take it. I stopped reading a chapter 17 and skimmed through the rest and of course something bad happened. I wasn't so upset about the kidnapping. I was far more upset about what happened between Juliette and Killian. It was heartbreaking. I literally felt the pain of it and I wasn't even reading the whole thing. However I found myself going back to what I skipped over and reading it. The grand finale at the end wasn't so great. It should have been more elaborate. That epilogue was meh. I was expecting more. It could have been an awesome book if there was more happiness. They were happy times but it didn't feel genuine because it had a looming darkness that overshadowed it.

""When pain is all youve ever known, how do you accept that you deserve good in your life?""

The writing is excellent. I was able to feel the emotion and a connection to the characters as I was reading. The story is engaging; I felt like I was there as the story played out. I highly recommend this series. You won`t be disappointed.

Chloe's publisher, Hank Hammond, argued with several employees that evening and his wife found out that he had TWO mistresses! When he was later found dead there were so many suspects it was going to take the police a long time to find the murderer. Daisy couldn't let her friend, Chloe, be declared guilty so she decided to find out who the real killer was. Detective Stern was handling the case but he wasn't happy about Daisy's interference in the investigation.

I have always liked the Daisy McDare books and the way she solves the crimes. They are well written, light mysteries that are fun to read. Unlike some other reviewers, this wasn't my favourite. I thought it was slow starting with the first 20% or so giving information about Daisy that wasn't necessary. In general, this book wasn't as interesting as the others in this series.

I completely fell in love with Leslie, although I had fallen for him before, this book just proved that my love for the funny, quirky guy was well founded and deserved.

Leslie has a tendency to put his foot in his mouth, but it is honestly so heartwarming to read about a character who will say what they feel, and I have been told on many occasions that I need a filter....so I feel as if me and Leslie are one in the same. Although that man can rock the heels so much better than I.

Oliver, has scars - both on the outside and inside. That man wound his way into my heart, and I am so grateful that he did.

While the other boys are discovering the charms of the opposite sex, Zac realizes he has it bad for a slightly older neighbor boy, Rory. Zac escapes into his own world of drawings and fantasies.

Art of the Heart is a bittersweet coming of age story. In just a few pages, the author captures the pathos of growing up in a small town knowing you're different than everyone else, and dealing with that first crush which is made tougher by being unrequited.

Dont be fooled by the subject or plot into thinking this is some sappy Young Adult (YA) story. Art of the Heart is a story mature adults will probably relate to more than teens or twenty-somethings. The effects of first love can only really be appreciated from some distance. Theres a maturity to the story that belies the plot line, which is not to say the characters are unbelievable. In fact, they seem quite real. Its just that they are drawn from a perspective one doesnt often see in stories about young people.",0.9639,72.05,1

I have to be very honest, when I first started reading this book, I was trying to figure out why there was a need for sequels. Then it all hit at once and I fell into the story without another thought. It may have a very slow start, but the buildup behind it is amazing!

The narrator was as amazing in this as she was the first book. I really adored her. I'd love to listen to more books by this narrator. The story was good itself, but she enhanced it even more and brought life to all of the characters.

I think I might have been frustrated by the series if I read it as it was released, because each of the first books stopped very abruptly. Luckily, I didn't get put onto these books until all four were released.

I also must applaud the author of providing quality length novels. These were no novellas.

As for the actual content and presentation. Literally the only odd thing was the use of random thesaurus words that don't show up with frequency in the English language. I could guess their meanings from context clues, but I did find myself looking up a few definitions in each book.

The characterization of the main and support characters, and the development of the plot was flawless! The character's had enough of a history for them to be real, and they went through the right amount of hardships in moving toward commitment. She beautifully crafted an alpha warrior, while also allowing him to have a certain level of love and adoration of his woman.

Kindle_Store_5,5,0,"I've read a few of the short stories based in the near future where our online lives are run by autos, smart apps designed to make our lives easier. The author creates a plausible and sinister vision of the future which I'd enjoyed. Now all of the stories have been combined into a single book, along with some new stories so I was eager to read through them.

I'll admit that I was tempted to skip through the stories that I'd read previously, but I'm glad that I didn't. The short stories provided different snap shots of the world the author has created and while they were excellwent reads in their own right, they are so much better when re-read with the wider context this book provides.

The overall story is great, the different glimpses tantilise with what is going on before drawing together into a conclusion that both feels logical and satisfies. It's also open to allow further books in the series which I hope is the intent.

As well as providing a good story the author writes well, although in many ways this is a bleak world that he creates it is still full of life and humour. Overall this is a great read that I'm happy to recommend to anyone.",0.9963,64.34,1
Kindle_Store_5,4,0,"I admit to being a dog show addict, but this series should capture mystery lovers who wouldn't know a St Bernard from a Pekingese. Harbert explains enough about the ins and outs of the dog world for the reader to understand the plot without burying it in jargon. And the plot has enough suspense to keep the reader glued to all its twists and turns.

Jennifer, the narrator of the first three books, alternates with Sabrina, the teen-age rising star of the dog show world. This is partly because of Sabrina's  closeness in age to the teens and sub-teens showing their dogs in Junior Showmanship competition and also because there is just too much happening for Jennifer to narrate it all believably. Characters, human and canine, from the previous books develop their personalities and the backgrounds continue to be so clearly described that you feel you could walk into them.

The denouement follows smoothly from what has gone before. I have only one criticism of the ending and that relates to the dog show suspense, not the mystery. There is a plot thread left dangling and I, at least, want to know what happened.

I look forward to the next book to satisfy my curiosity as well as provide a good read.",0.9574,66.88,1

Waking Up

by Kirsten Clare

I am a huge fan of both Hideo and Tessa. They were both so young and had everything going for them in a way that I thought was totally unexpected.

Hideo was a fourteen year old boy who had a crush on Tessa. He was also the older sister of a famous businessman who had a crush on him. He was a good guy and was very involved with the club. Tessa was a very vulnerable girl who had no idea she was in a relationship with anyone but her best friend. She was a shy girl who had a crush on him from the very beginning.

The chemistry between them was amazing. They both had their ups and downs and they both had some ups and downs that made the chemistry between them melt. The chemistry between them was unbelievable. It was not a bad book but I would have liked more of the chemistry between them.

Tessa and Hideo had such a great",0.9859,81.83,1

Then you jump ahead a little bit and see a lot of characters from the Sizzling Miami series which I loved! They slowly build up their relationship together which I thought was perfect and I could really feel the love between these two.
The Dom and Sub relationship this author portrayed was awesome! The whole storyline with the action, angst and the steam just damn so many scenes in this book were so hot!!

Trouble finished their European tour and Katie and Tyler talked all the time and skyped every night. Now that they are back together again and more in love, things are going to take work and nothing worth anything will be easy. More secrets are revealed and they both have to live with mistakes they made and things that happened.

This book is rather sweet. But also infuriating at times. The author goes to lengths to show just how highly educated and wonderful Keelin is but she manages to do some fairly stupid things whilst in Ireland.

I liked the mixture of modern day life with the ancient magic which surrounds Keelin and her family. Keelin's romance with the man next door was rather hot with their chemistry being intense but they were a couple I wanted to know more about outside of their sexual compatibility.

Wild Irish Heart is an enjoyable romance story with a gorgeous setting. The characters were a little flat but considering this story was less than two hundred pages, I think there was probably just wasn't enough time to get to know them as much as I would have liked.

Lorelei was stuck in a self imposed rut raising her daughter and Jack was in a self imposed denial because of what his mom did to him. The push and pull was fantastic until the walls came crumbling down. From the beginning Lorelei put Jack in his place only problem was Jack opened his mouth before he thought which hurt her. Jack didn't realize he did because Lorelei was a first for him. As they continued to explore and push each other Jack is thrown into a situation way out of his control factor which helps open his eyes for a little while anyway. He refuses to admit anything until he thinks he might loose her for good. Being a strong independent woman makes her show who is boss. I found it hard to put this down.

This is her first real assignment for Nemesis, after helping them previously. She will be posing as a maid which is easy for her because she grew up in service. Nemesis has assigned her a partner for this mission. Ada only knows it is a man, posing as a footman. She only hopes it is not Michael who she worked with last time. Things got rather personal with Michael, and Ada was very hurt that she's never heard from him in the past six months after the mission.

Michael, who also grew up in service, specifically asked for this assignment so he could see Ada again. He is hoping that, in addition to getting the evidence they require, that perhaps things can start again with Ada.

I really liked how this whole novella pretty much took place ""below stairs"" from the servants' point of view. Michael and Ada have to sneak around constantly, even with the other servants, because if anyone suspects anything going on romantically between them, they'll get sacked. That helps build the romantic tension in the story. Recommended for readers who like the full-length Nemesis books.",0.969,72.87,1

Levi and Grace have both had difficult things to deal with in the past which have left them both reluctant to trust or let anyone get close to them. Thrown together in unusual circumstances, this is the story of two people who find their walls breaking down and that trust and love are possible.

Grace is a determined and stubborn person, despite (or maybe because of) the circumstances that have surrounded her life. She also has a softness to her, and I was on her side right from the beginning. Levi is a self-sufficient but thoroughly sweet and gentlemanly man.

The author once again gifts readers with a substantive and poignant portrayal of the human heart.

I loved the distinctiveness of all the secondary characters, each of whom had a crystal clear portrayal.  The Long Island setting and mystique was a character in its own right - I love when an author portrays setting so vividly that I feel as if I am a participant within the story and not simply reading it. The mystery held so many possibilities, just when I thought I was sure of one facet, I found myself doubting... excellent maneuvering of plot, with a great twist at the end.

All of the events from the first two books come full circle, but not before Ryan and Leigh go through a roller coaster of emotions and have to confront many truths about his past.

If you're on the hunt for something that feels both paranormal and contemporary, this is a series that somehow manages to feel like both. And S.K.

Kindle_Store_5,4,0,"Back in 2011 I got a chance to read Because of You by Jessica Scott. This is where you first meet Shane Garrison and Jen St. James. I strongly suggest you read that story first, before jumping into this novella. However, it is just a suggestion. Here's why:

In Anything for You Shane and Jen have been together for sometime. Shane is about to do something and he's afraid to tell Jen what he is about to do. I don't know what the man was thinking when he thought it was a good idea not to tell Jen. Fortunately, he has a good buddy who has talked some sense into him. I know this is very vague, but it's a novella. If I say to much, I might tell the whole story. Plus, a lot of the background is in the first book of the  Coming Home series. Overall, it is a quick read (seriously) in which you get to see Shane and Jen work out there relationship and over come there fears of what could happen. It was enjoyable and it's nice to see Jen and Shane again. So, I actually hope you get to read both stories Because of You and Anything for You. So, I leave you today and I hope it's wonderful.",0.9694,90.7,1
Kindle_Store_5,3,0,"Overall, this is a cheesy, predictable, but cute little romance/chick lit.

It's one of those books where the reader can figure out the general plot within a few pages. There are no surprises here! That said, other than the main character's total inability to figure out her flatmate's motives, these are likeable characters (Josh is practically saintly, which stretches suspension of belief to an extreme) and it's a fun, if rather far-fetched, plot.

However, it could so easily have been a good deal better. Romantic comedies, be they in films or books, are generally thoroughly predictable, but there's foreshadowing and then there's LOOK THIS IS WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. A touch more subtlety would not have gone amiss! It is at least fairly short, or the plot would get even more contrived.

On top of that, it needs a good proofread to weed out the careless mistakes. Lots of capitalisation of speech tags, words missing out, misused/typo'd words (were for wear, for example), etc. Generally I don't expect perfection from self-pubbed efforts, but I do expect the writer to take a little more time to fix basic, easily corrected errors like this.

So... reasonably engaging characters, and the book is entertaining enough (with at least one laugh-out-loud moment), but if I'd paid list price for it, I'd feel pretty short-changed.",0.9904,61.36,1

Kindle_Store_5,4,0,"I've had my eye on this series ever since I got to read a snippet of the forthcoming first book in the series, Caged Warrior, due out in June of this year, and so I snapped up this novella as soon as I had the chance.

Dark and unapologetically gritty, this story was full of pulse-pounding action, and earthy heat that keeps you begging for more.

I loved that the heroine was a true warrior -- she isn't one of those supposedly ""strong"" heroines who suddenly turns weak and dependent on a hero halfway through the story. Instead, she lives up to her reputation as a fearsome warrior, and gives our hero, Hark, a real run for his money.

While I'm never one for a whirl-wind romance, and I didn't care for the fact that the ending was more of a Happy For Now than a Happily Ever After, there was no denying that the courtship between these two, and the ending of the story simply fit with these two characters and the world that they lived in.

There was also one of, if not the most romantic scenes ever, despite the blood and brutality involved.

A very solid 4/5 Stars.

She did not disappoint.  Don't let the fact that it is a YA book deter you.  It is still a wonderful story that kept me engaged.  I read it in less than 24 hours.

I really enjoyed Jessie's story and her coming to terms with her mother's death and finding out her biological father is a rock star.  I'll never be in that exact situation but it was fun and full of drama but still realistic and down to earth if that makes sense.  It was easy to relate to Jessie.  It was also fun catching up with Meg and Johnny.

I gave this book 4 instead of 5 stars because I do feel that some of situations in the book were a bit mature for younger audiences.  There is drinking, and smoking.  *spoiler alert* The characters don't go further than kissing but I feel that some terms used were a bit mature.  That's probably just me though.

Kindle_Store_5,5,0,"Josh Anvil and the Pivotal Weapon by Bruce Arrington is a YA fantasy about the fourteen-year-old Josh and his heroic adventures outwitting the evil alien Raga and saving Earth from invasion.

Joshs human friend Troy accompanies him, along with Anton, a humanoid alien slave from another world. They meet up with more of Antons people, plus a helpful renegade alien, along the way.

This is the second adventure about Josh and his friends, and this time our hero has mind melded with an intelligent power that guides him into rescuing Antons son and a remarkable young woman who can split planets. Our hero pilots an organic spaceship made from a tree. It replicates Joshs favorite meals (fast food tacos and barbeque pizzas) and conjures cool teen clothes (jeans and t-shirts with snappy sayings).

Mixed in with the fun romp, the story examines more serious themes about Joshs loyalty, not only to his close friends, but also to the welfare of Earth. Our hero struggles with the consequences of rash and revengeful actions. The end of the story is a satisfying conclusion to the current set of adventures, and sets the stage for more fun to come in the sequel.

This is his first full-length novel, and it's a real treat. It is a self-contained sequel to a short-story entitled Rediscovering Danielle, and you don't have to read that at all to enjoy this one - although I'd recommend reading both, the short story nicely sets up the characters and their backstory and is a highly entertaining read in its own right.

Just Watch Me takes Dean and Danielle to exotic Hawaii, where the atmosphere lends itself well to  taking their little marital game of hubby-watching-wife-flirting-in-a-bar a little further, into the saucy realms of actually (gasp!) seeing her with other people. The story is well-paced and explores the whole risk-and-reward dilemma of a married couple very much in love challenging themselves sexually with the tickle of jealousy to fan their passions - it's naughty, it's spicy, it's so hot with scenes that will lodge firmly in the memory, but Kenny Wright plays it just perfectly in teasing out the nervous energy without piling on the pain, and leaving you with a satisfying HEA.",0.9824,48.47,1

I was introduced to the series from a friend of mine that knows I am not a big sci-fi fan but after I read the first book - I just kept going. The book is a great example of a military sci-fi that puts you on a action packed journey full of surprises. The character development is top notch and the book is very well written. I personally fell in love with the character ""Spartan"" the most. The book has a ton of stuff going on including some terrorism which I believe is a way of connecting the reader to a more present state of whats currently going on around us in today's society.

The hero is turned off women, resenting his mother and all the shallow, greedy women of the ton she tries to marry him off to.  The heroine is distrustful of men because of having the most horrendous, abusive father you could ever imagine.  A father who's arranging her marriage to an older ship captain and white slaver, who equals or surpasses the father in horrendous behavior.

She runs away from home to escape marriage and he runs away from London, basically for the same reason, except in his case he wasn't really in any desperate situation.

Well, you know what will happen by reading the blurb but not exactly all the particulars, some of which are fun and interesting.  No real unicorn here, of course, but the symbolism plays a part in the story.  There are also some entertaining secondary characters, although nobody is drawn with much dimension.

However, this is not Chater's best work.  I did not like the hero much. Too immature, too erratically friendly and then cold and almost mean to the heroine.  Still, the writing is good.

I would definitely recommend this one. It's a cute story and I look forward to more from this author,  I hope Mike, Jonathon and Indi get their own stories!

I so much enjoyed the complexity of the plot and the wonderful uniqueness of the world and characters created in all three books of The Trinity Saga I have read so far. The idea of the stone angels, Nemuri, that rule the underworld, their connection to the watch keepers, the three princesses and their guardian knights, the forest made out of memories that light up, the identity of Pandora, it all took me on a wonderful journey where I savored every page. I tend to evaluate fantasy authors on the uniqueness and the beauty of the world they unroll for us,and the intelligence of overall design - Ronnell D.Porter passed with flying colors. I read a lot of fantasy and consider myself picky within the genre; it is difficult for me to find the author who has it all and settle with the book, so I am totally rejoiced with discovering this one.

Kindle_Store_5,5,0,"Ruthie Knox is a new to me author. About Last Night put her on my must buy list. The characters are realistic with flaws for both Cath and Nev that makes your heart ache for them on their journey for their HEA (happily ever after).

Cath comes from a hard life where she regrets choices she made. She doesn't feel worthy of Nev. She puts limitations on their relationship to keep from making the same mistakes. Gradually, the limitations change as Cath changes.

Nev has his own struggles with family and career choice. He goes along with Cath's limitations because he wants to breakdown the walls around her heart. However, for them to find their HEA, Nev also makes changes to merge together the two sides of his character (who he is and who his family wants him to be).

This combination of character struggles and development makes for a great read that had me turning the pages eager to see what would happen next and how they would overcome it all for HEA.

The book is set in England. Ms. Knox did a great job of writing Nev true to his background with English terms and sayings that added to the story and character.

Patty Jansen has done a remarkable world building job, building a complex interplanetary society structured around 'gamra,' with earth and humanity as we mostly know it, sitting on the periphery. Cory Wilson is earth's second ambassador to 'gamra' - but the first ambassador who actually understands the society he's about to be thrust into.

The politics, cultural differences and language differences are complex, but well developed and understandable, and I was easily drawn into the world that she created. At times I felt as hot and bothered and exhausted as Cory, struggling to adapt to the heat of a world far from earth, or as frozen as Thayen, drenched and shivering from experiencing temperatures well below her norm.

The story moved rapidly, and I was drawn in very quickly, and kept tapping the pages of my kindle much longer than I should really have been awake.

I've been reading Science Fiction for a long time. This story is good. It's not simplistic, but neither is it so far out of left field that it has more culture than character.

Stylo's writing style is one of my favorites. She captures your attention from the first pages of her books and this one is not different. At the same time, this book is nothing like her others. I felt like I was watching an action movie while reading it. Her attention to details and how well researched everything in her books is doesn't go unnoticed. It makes the experience of reading this book feel much more real.

The story is incredibly well written. The descriptions of the places make you feel as if you're there. The characters are intriguing, and captivating. Marc and Lily are headstrong, brave and they are focused on getting their respective jobs done. These two make quite the dynamic duo. They had me clutching my heart, laughing and swooning.

These are not supposed to mix in a relationship, but you know what happens when something's forbidden...

Zach's character is tormented and has never gotten past losing his love over three hundred years ago.  It is easy to empathize with him, and to understand why he keeps Shasa at arms length.  I did have a difficult time seeing the two of them together, for some reason they just did not click for me...I just didn't feel that spark between them, I'm not sure exactly why.

I'm subtracting a half star, though, because I came across 30+ grammar-type errors.  None of them were significant to the story or the meaning of a sentence, just small things like using the wrong tense, the wrong spelling for sound-alike words, or leaving out or adding in extra words incorrectly.

Kindle_Store_5,5,0,"This is a beautifully-written book by a highly literate author who has a respect for the written word. No gimmicks, no hype, nothing that's cheap about the all-important subject of coming of age...how refreshing! Reading the chapter titles alone is stimulating, because you get a glimpse of the structure of the book without being told the exact details (which of course, entices you to want to see how the story plays outs).

The realism of the book draws the reader in effortlessly. The journey is epic and dramatic without being formulaic or repetitious. There are many poignant lines throughout the content too, which give the book added depth and insight. I think the following line (from one of the chapters in The Same Moon) describes the book very well: ""Life was no film set, and there was no script."" I particularly enjoyed Chapter Five: The Courtship for its unabashed view on ""the dating game.""

As someone who enjoys culture and travelling, this book was certainly a treat. The strength of books like these is that they remind discerning readers how literature is differentiated from the film medium. While the latter tends to be more impressive in terms of 'visuals', good literature is intimate because it engages the reader through a one-on-one experience. That is one of the things I enjoy the most about reading, which The Same Moon delivers.",0.9827,60.55,1

As a novella, the story ramps up to speed quickly.  Moeller does a very good job introducing new elements, like hyperspace and its risks, plus the equipment aboard the spaceship, all in the middle of a steady stream of exploits and conflicts the characters must deal with.

Everything comes together in a nice package.  The action is well done and kept me furiously turning pages.  But wait, theres more.

Mixed in with hyperspace and spaceships is the interesting concept of hyperspace microbes that can possess a human mind, driving the person insane.  These microbes are kept out of the spaceship by a special shield, so there shouldnt be any problems, right?

Thats where the plot pulls off some unexpected twists and turns, making for a fun read.  Moeller keeps up the pace all the way to the end.  Amazingly, for a novella there is much more that could be said, but I fear explaining anymore will reveal too much.

4 stars for Chicago-a shot to the heart changes everything by AJ Harmon.  If you are looking for a sweet, wholesome romance, this is the book for you!

When southern gentleman, Alex Beaumont, meets the tough yet sweet Mia from Chicago, they don't really think they would have anything in common. However, after having dinner one night, they each discover that they are quite attracted to one another.  They are each in their 30's, and shockingly, neither one of them has ever been in a serious relationship.  To say that they both need to experience that unconditional love and support in their lives would be a huge understatement.  It will take sacrifices on both sides, but if they are willing to take some risks, they might just find what has been missing in each of their lives.

AJ Harmon is an excellent wordsmith who brings both her characters and the places she writes about to life through her descriptive details.  I honestly felt like I was right there in the middle of the story alongside the characters experiencing their ups and downs with them.  I really look forward to reading more from this author!

It's a little sweeter than the other two. The sex is still explicit and fairly frequent but just the overall tone was sweeter for me, in a good way, than the other two. Mack and Hud still have some sarcasm that go back and forth but Hud is just such a sweet guy. Hud has been playing football for 10 years and so is more mature and is ready for something else in his personal life. I loved Hud and Macks interactions together and the building of their relationship. It was genuine and believable for me. Nothing was rushed or forced. I was able to just dive in and stay there until I reached the end. In this book, Hud's football has reached the playoffs and so they are dealing with their relationship, who they are to the team, and the extra pressure from wanting to win the championship.

When his wife died he was having a fling with a woman who really got to him. Then he found out that his wife took her life, not because of him but because of her own nature. That's a whole other ball of wax. Anyway his father agrees to be interviewed by the star of a show that showcases western lifestyles, because the original story was about his family as a kid and what had become of them. That led to Jason, JD's father.well turns out that the woman doing the interviews is the woman he had that weekend with, that he can't seem to forget.

Logan was the one night stand.

Now a twist if fate has them meet up again in somewhat secret circumstances.
Cass is Logans boss but she has no clue about his secret that could change everything.

This book started off at a steady pace, then it slowed down in the middle and hit it's stride again in the last 3rd.

Cass and Logan are both head strong and career driven. They have different experiences in life and this shows in each interaction they have. Because of the complexity of their situation there are a lot of undercurrents in their conversations, but only one of them is aware of it.

The author has done a good job showing the different sides to her characters personalities. The chemistry between Logan and Cass never diminishes and the love they have for their daughter despite the intricacies they face shines through and comes above everything else.

I enjoyed this story. The characters and the storyline is consistent and interesting and I liked the dynamics of the other relationships each Cass and Logan have with others such as Logan's grandmother and Cass's friend Patricia. Those relationships added another layer and also a bit of lightness to the storyline.

This is a great holiday read and worth one clicking if you like a good romance!

The author has written something reminiscent of the film ""You've Got Mail"". A shop, The Gingerbread Cafe, has been in a small town for years, and has been an extremely successful business. Then someone else comes in and opens up something similar right across the road (as opposed to 'just around the corner' in the film.)

This starts a battle between the 2 proprietors to gain business from the townsfolk.

Who will win? Will it be the reliable young woman, Lily, who has been a constant in the lives of her customers for years? Or will it be the young interloper, Damon, who triumphs due to his good looks and apparently irresistible charm?

The author has written a lovely novella, with just the right tone and information, to make this a great story.

The character of CeeCee, Lily's partner in crime in the cafe, is a great one! She is such a sassy woman.

My only gripe is that the story wasn't longer! I would love to know more about Lily and the cafe, CeeCee and her family, and the heartache Lily went through a few years before. Perhaps a prequel in the making? Hint hint Ms Raisin?

Kindle_Store_5,5,0,"Well--appears Fiona Gavelle is up to her legal antics again.  And her writer, Una Tiers, is up to her tricks again, delivering yet another page-turner with ""Not Safe for the Bank(er)"".

Ms Tiers calls it a short story.  I would bicker with that classification and call it, rather, a novella, or, a short novel.  It provides all the satisfaction one receives from a work that is longer than a short story, in that allows for a fuller development of character, and a plot that can be more convoluted with considerably more back story.

Fiona Gavelle was introduced in ""Judge vs. Nuts"" as a newbie attorney solving a murder mystery while stumbling and tripping her way through a legal system that doesn't favor the still innocent and idealistic attorney in her dealings with the ""good ol' boys"" of the bar.

In this book, we get the feeling that Fiona, thank goodness, still hasn't lost her innocence and idealism while doing the leg work for her client-by-default, Mr. Fives.  (You'll have to read it to find out just how he fell in her lap--but it's an enjoyable challenge).

Between the first book and this one there is a perceptible growth and maturity in the character of Fiona Gavelle.  But it is refreshing to rediscover that the revolving door still can slap her in the butt.

The storyline pulled me in and though it is the first in a series I am already loving it for there was so much more between Meadow and Kyson. The cute way they completed each other and easy way there were towards each other is what makes its characters so memorable. Kysons attitude about a cover model was genuine to the point of making him think of Fabio was hillarious. Meadow now is a woman I loved right away for she reminded me of me with insecurities, fear yet still with hope her one love will appear.

Kindle_Store_5,5,0,"How do I describe Focus On Me? Specifically all the feels Riley and Colin gave me?

I have to start by thanking Megan Erickson, again, for telling their story. What a beautiful, emotional story it was. I wanted to give Riley all the hugs in the world.

Much like the previous book (Trust the Focus), Focus On Me has it all  sweet, tender moments; super sexy ones; a few laughs, and a lot of heartache, but it's worth it in the end. Riley goes through hell, but he survives it, with Colin by his side.

I loved that Erickson didn't try to sugar coat anything. Riley had problems with depression, and even with all the love, f*&ks, and hugs from Colin, the depression wasn't going to magically disappear. Some authors, I'm sorry to say, seem to think love instantly cures all. No, it doesn't, but love can help a person to get through the tough parts, and there's no doubt that Colin was able to help Riley with that.

Once again, my Kindle copy is full of highlights. I look forward to whatever Erickson has for us next  but, please, can you go a little easier on my heart next time? (pause) Who am I kidding, that's why I love this series so much. Keep the emotions coming!

Kindle_Store_5,3,0,"So this is a series novel....not a big fan of those. Since this book is the start of the series, you would think that the author would have taken her time setting the story up. When the H and h meet for the first time the chemistry is instantaneous. I'm okay with because sometimes in life you meet a person and that can happen. HOWEVER, to have these two meet have sex and then decide they are in love? I'm calling straight BS on that. And what man wants to dive head first into some woman's drama because she's so beautiful and he just has to have her in his life?  And here we go once again with the black woman always having green eyes ,hazel eyes, light brown eyes,etc. Why not just beautiful brown eyes? I'm being petty sorry. Anyway the story although good moves along way too fast for me. They meet..she introduces him to her drama...he protects...they have sex...her life gets threatened again...there's a big dramatic scene with the villain H saves the day... this time they have unprotected sex...then proposes like a week later or three months later...either way. Too soon. I like it when a relationship gets to marinate the characters get to know each other the chemistry and suspense build up so that we can genuinely be excited when the two main characters come together...none of that happened here.",0.9634,84.88,1

Kindle_Store_5,4,0,"This was a good plot and I really enjoyed the beginning of the book as the plot began to unfold. A young 24year old girl, her mother has died leaving her to bring up her younger brother and sister. She finally begins her dreams of studying which will hopefully lead to fulfilment of dreams in the business world when she has an on and off attraction to her university professor.

It seems the young lady makes lots of assumptions along the way and it is a little difficult to understand how she comes to fall in love with the professor considering she spends so much time full of unwarranted anger with him. He on the other hand is like a typical male, thinking he is being considerate and all the time pushing all the wrong buttons. Except the right buttons that lead to an apparent pregnancy.

I shan't ruin the rest of the story. The book is well written, I think it would be nice if the heroin role was not filled with so much anger and assumptions, which leads the reader to feel there is a lot of 'love' that seems to be missing from this love story, however somehow it finds its natural ending.

Returning home after breaking away from an abusive relationship, the heartache is not over. The patriarch of the family has been murdered and the family is reeling from the loss and the continuing threat to their business and their lives. Jared Corbit is her sister Lexis boyfriend and she wished she felt brotherly thoughts towards to him. What was she going to do?

Told from Savannahs point of view, her emotional turmoil feels so real. There seems to be one punch after another to herself and those around her and the anguish and she feels cannot be hidden. The author knows just the right thing to say to convey the mood, the feelings of uncertainty, pain and love. And there is a lot of love in this story despite tackling the serious issues. Abuse and its ripple effect, abandonment and its life-long consequences are at the center of Savannahs struggle as she tries to deal with her family and the situation she finds herself in now. Jared is more than she feels she deserves and the roller coaster of events that happen don't ease that feeling.

Chantal Fernando's incredible writing combined action packed scenes and a healthy dose of freaking HOT characters and their kick ass love interests has become a knockout favourite of myself and many, and I for one cannot wait for Vinnie's story (Wolf's Mate) out in August.

Talon is an interesting character that has all the bad assery of an MC President of the Wild Men MC with the sweetness of a Wind Dragon MC Hottie. I liked that he wasn't the biggest manwhore of the bunch. I loved watching him get through his feelings for Tia.

Tia is freaking hilarious, she says it like it is no lies no games. Being a single mum she has her fair share of problems and having Talon come in when life gets harder is a bonus plus for her.

As a couple they rock the pages and bring about a different flavour to the series as a whole. Alliances will have to be upheld for this couple to flourish.

The sexy scenes are sweet and spicy.

Overall I LOVED IT!!!!!! and I cannot WAIT for Wolf's Mate!!!! Mine is already pre-ordered and awaiting publication!!!! This series gets better and better with each instalment and I love how there is an opening for more Wind Dragon MC and Wild Men MC Hotties to get their HEA's.

Kindle_Store_5,2,0,"I read this book all of the way through. He explains a lot of things about quantum physics and other related subjects thoroughly. In fact, it was the most concise explanation for the new scientific discoveries that I have read in one book. But where the author goes wrong, in my opinion, is when he acts as though the Law of Attraction and its related theories work to make you wealthy. He says that all you have to do is have positive thinking and you will attract wealth and other great things into your life. The reason why I have singled out wealth is because he does. He believes that you can become a millionaire and even a billionaire if you use the Law of Attraction correctly.

After talking and talking about his concepts I jumped ahead to the author's story. I wanted to see what the Law of Attraction had brought into his life. He said he was doing well with his software company but he lost everything. Immediately after losing everything he wrote this book. I had to laugh! What better proof that the author didn't know what he was talking about can be inferred by his situation? Naturally, if his concepts worked he would be a successful billionaire by now! If you want to read about the recent revelations about quantum physics this is an excellent book to read. Other than that, at least it was free.",0.9958,73.17,1

Now none of this was explicit at this point, just distracting talk of passion and desires. But it was constant on and off between the plot, so the desire and passion overtook the nice laid out plot already in place. 3rd at the end not too surprising the hero and heroine could not wait to have sex, before they got married, and they did this in the hero's house with his mother and sister there. He said his mother would be happy to see her in the morning at breakfast...  REALLY! This is regency era, no mom is happy to wake up and find out your son had his girlfriend come over in the middle of the night to sleep with him and then have breakfast with the family. BTW, before sleeping together he did propose at least. I can't tell you exactly how explicit the love scene was, as I glanced at it only enough to skip the pages to the ending. I was disappointed.

Not only is I Let You Go a fast paced physiological thriller it's also a intimate portrail of tragedy, loss, survival, and emotional undoing.

When I sleep Im assaulted by the sights and sounds of the accident; by the knowledge that had I been just a few minutes earlier, it would never have happened Jenna feels responsible for the tragedy and won't allow herself to find joy in anything as she feels she doesn't deserve it. She moves to a small town in Welsh to try and put her life back together. While there she is withdrawn from everyone and everything. Eventually she finds a small amount of happiness in taking photographs. About half way through the book their is a major twist that I for one did not see coming. The author portrays Jenna in such a way that you actually feel like you are in the book with her. The book is a devastatingly real look at how tremendous tragedy and guilt can affect every aspect of ones life to the point it can be debilitating.

Kindle_Store_5,4,0,"I have read several of the stories in this series and this one is probably the most hilarious. In this series men can get pregnant. It's actually the way they know that the other man is their true mate. And all have to get over some obstacles to reach their HEA.

Bobby decides that he has to get away from his family. After having seen his brother be awfully abused by their own father and knowing that his fate would be similar when his true nature was revealed, he knows he must seek out. Stupidly enough he starts his get away journey on a very cold night. Poorly dressed he is fortunate to meet Nick and his two friends who are driving aimlessly around. They deliver him at the ranch where his brother Isaac is living with his mate.
Bobby meets his own mate there, but he does not want to give in, not to begin with anyway. It takes some effort from Shott and help from among others Shott's grandfather before the stubborn Bobby realizes where his future lies.

There are some quite distinct hints as to who Nick actually is and some magic wielded to underline that. There is a mentioning of a crossroad demon. And the solution as to who had sent the killer after Bobby is not easy to accept.

I have the feeling this might be last book of this series, but there is always Mason who still is without a mate.",-0.8865,80.11,1
Kindle_Store_5,4,0,"I've heard a lot about Alisha Rai but I've never actually read any of her work before PLAY WITH ME. Whoo, now I'm starting to think I should correct that...because this book is hot!

Tatiana and Wyatt were teenage lovers. Then they had a bad split. Now, Tatiana is about to contact Wyatt again for the first time in years because, by striking coincidence, it turns out that her biological brother (with whom she recently met for the first time) has gotten in trouble for stealing from Wyatt's casino and he and his young family can't afford the consequences if Wyatt presses charges. Tatiana is hoping to plead her brother's case.

Typed out like that, it kind of sounds like the set-up to some bad porn. Which, technically, I guess it is. PLAY WITH ME is an erotic short, clocking in at just over 100 pages, and about 85% of those pages consist of sex scenes, or build-ups to sex scenes.

But PLAY WITH ME is a cut above most erotica I've read. The characters are well written, with real flaws and insecurities. Their emotions are conceivably realistic. The dirty talk is good. The scenarios are well written, consensual, erotic, and somewhat inventive. Both the hero and heroine get off, and have open communication with one another about what they want and what their expectations are.

Her visit to the Hub, although not her first was interesting, she definitely got more than she had bargained for.  I loved her group of friends, Bella was a good friend, as was Mackenzie in return.

Kennedy had a strong group of friends too; in Julien, Reece and Grant.  We already know Reece's story and I'm sure Grant and Julien's are going to be Fab.  Although they were together for Reece's bachelor party, they really had Kennedy's back.

As eccentric as Julien is, he helped Kennedy see sense and made him realize he had been a fool.

Kindle_Store_5,5,0,"This very enjoyable story takes unusual directions from the start. Our heroine is a young woman of respectable background who has had her life ruined by a wealthy man. She has been banished to a convent. Meanwhile our hero is a man who went to America as a trader but took the losing side in the Civil War and has returned, with only a ship, to take up a family title. He learns that he will relinquish the lands if he does not marry and produce an heir by a certain date, which is only a few months away. This option appears to be impossible until as luck would have it, he meets our heroine who is in an interesting condition.

A somewhat creepy item is that the hero's ship carries the remains of his mother whom he wishes to bury on her family land. Why he could not do that without owning the land is unclear. The wish seemed tossed in to make the hero more altruistic and less land-grabbing. We are reminded of a certain character several times by the heroine pointedly asking what can have become of her or a message she carried. This builds to a suspense finale which again is most unusual in period romances.

Read, enjoy, be surprised. There is lots of fun historical detail such as how inheritance worked and this has to be explained to the hero for our benefit, he having been in America for twenty years.",0.9947,69.21,1

This was an amazing continuation to the Levi and Nix's story that we begin in Body, Ink and Soul. This book picks up right where that book ended so we don't miss a beat (and if you remember the cliffhanger that book ended on you are going to be really glad the author made it a smooth transition!) this book has a few more difficult moments in it and it helps strengthen the love story. As they say in the book ""you have seen me at my best and now you've seen me at my worst"" and this story is a good example of love truly conquering all! We see all of our favorite characters from book 1 and get caught up on what is going on in their lives. I could see where there might be more books in this series because there are some relationships that beg to be explored!

There are plenty of the same tingles and warm fuzzies that the first book brought about which sometimes doesn't happen in a direct continuation novel but I was pleased to note that the same magic I discovered in book 1 was present and maybe even stronger as we see the next chapter in Levi and Nix's story.

I first picked this book up because Entangled started this Bliss line and it was pretty clean as far as romances go.  I don't know what's happened but for me, a lot of the Bliss line books have crossed over and include scenes that are definitely not clean in my opinion.  And yes, I realize this is a very subjective topic.  I'm just giving my opinion on the matter.  In this book there are sexual situations, the outright sex is not described, but things leading up to it are.  If you don't mind that, this might be the book for you.

It presents stories of dark things lurking in completely unobtrusive places. A swimming pool, walls in a house, or even a wardrobe - suddenly they reveal a hidden evil which bereaves them of their inconspiciousness.

The Deep End (Robert McCammon)
Very straightforward and uncomplicated. My only criticism would be the unnecessary 'epilogue'. I guess this one is my favorite. 4 stars.

Interval (Norman Prentiss)
The first part really gave me the creeps because of its realistic subject. Unfortunately, the author added some supernatural element which didn't work out for me, but add confusion to an otherwise great story. 3 stars

If These Walls Could Talk (Shawntelle Madison)
Nice one with an unexpected twist that caught me by surprise and made me shudder. I loved the detail with the fox eye. 4 stars

The Night Hider (Graham Masterton)
Great reference to the author C.S. Lewis, though I would have preferred something more fantastic in the line of his work. The ending was not as climactic as expected and Jerry's sacrifice seemed unnecessary. 4 stars

Whatever (Richard Matheson)
A collection of song lyrics, interview snippets and articles, loosely connected into a story about a rockband. Dragged on and on without getting anywhere. Sorry, this was not my cup of tea. 1 star

This book you will really find that you will have a love hate relationship with Cooper while he is absolutely charming and sweeps Allison off of her feet at times he also acts like a complete and total jerk during others, so in other words a complete and total alpha male (sinfully delicious yes please!).

In fact, she is the only one who can.
Sophia was a great character. She was strong and brave and I loved her narration. Michael was the angel. He was moody, protective, and volatile.

Dante was the Demon Knight who was convinced that the reincarnated soul of his lost lover was in Sophia. He was one of those evil characters you couldn't help but somewhat enjoy because of their passion for whatever they are doing. Regardless, I am definitely Team Michael.

Youngs writing style makes you feel like you're sitting beside the characters listening to the story instead of reading it.

Weve met her throughout the series but getting up close and personal with her makes it so much more real.  I feel like I understand Harley now.  Seeing what she thinks and learning her history makes her more real, rather than just the catty girl weve come to know.  Getting a glimpse into Jakes mind is also quite revealing.  I may think his rationale is completely skewed but I understand (and like) him so much better now.  The contrast between the way the two main characters see themselves as compared to how they see each other definitely adds to the story.

The writing is good, it kept me interested and I constantly found myself laughing at Katy and also thinking what a little idiot she was.  She takes defiance almost to the point of ridiculousness, without regard for her safety - or Cal's.  In fact she's pretty lucky that she doesn't end up raped or killed at more than one point in her life.

I don't really know if you could call this a romance though... there doesn't seem to be a whole lot of romantic feelings between the characters.  Affection and sexual attraction, sure, but it almost seems as though the main reason for their marriage is just that Katy doesn't want to go back home to her mother and step-father.  Not that she has a really good reason for that other than being upset that her father was replaced so quickly by a new man - and forget the fact that her mother probably NEEDED a man to help her run their large ranch (something that Cal points out that makes Katy feel bad for about 2.5 seconds).

But the spankings are well deserved and kinda fun, the plot is fairly enjoyable and there writing is well done.  The best part about the book, in my opinion, are Cal's telegrams to Katy's mother.

Kindle_Store_5,3,0,"I received The Skeleton Garden from Netgalley, Alibi, and the Chatterbox program in exchange for an honest review.

The Skeleton Garden is the 4th book in a series about a gardener who seems to have bad things, i.e. bodies, turning up around her. And in this book there are actually a few. Pru, the main character is a gardener working with her older brother on the large garden of an English home, when they start digging up the yard to find out why a tree didn't grow, they come across a WWII plane and a skeleton. Not much later in the same hole another body appears and the town is excited to find out who committed the crime or if it was an accident.

This book had a very slow start, I have not read the first books in the series, so I really didn't have enough background about the characters to really feel for them - and even through the book, didn't really feel for them either. So it was hard to read. Yes the book picked up when the bodies started appearing and the investigations started but overall I was not feeling it.

I love a good mystery and this book did provide a few, which was nice, but not having connected with the characters I felt that something was missing for me. But like I said if you read the other books in the series, that may add to the connection with the characters that I did not have.",0.3096,73.71,1
Kindle_Store_5,2,0,"Usually i get on an author about not being descriptive enough, this is one of the few that i wish he'd shut up. Here's a quick example.

""There was a flurry of movement in the shadows and the boy darted out quick as a thought. He took three paces at a dead run and stopped, stretched out his arms and breathed deeply of the wonderful air, his chest puffing out like a sparrow's, and he grinned a grin that spread from ear to ear. He stood there with his breath held letting the sun, that ancient and inexorable skygod, still only just begun his day's journey smile its primordial light upon him, warming him.""

That's not even the whole paragraph, but that only three sentences, THREE! I got 4% into this book before i couldn't take anymore. The author seems to feel the need to explain or describe EVERYTHING with excruciating detail.

Some may enjoy this brand of writing, but if the rest of the book is anything like this (no reason to think its not going by other reviews) then i am all too happy that stopped. I gave it 2 stars even though i couldn't bring myself to finish it because, again, some may like it and i'm willing to give it the benefit of the doubt.

Oh, my, the writing. I'm not sure how I feel about this story. I had a lot of fun with the characters and the plot. I enjoyed the banter between the main characters.

I was surprised by this book. I thought I was going to read about someone bemoaning how bad and horrible love is, but I was pleasantly surprised!

Kelsye Nelson delivers a witty list in ""Five Things You'll Hate About Me"". After reading I realised that it's something most of us do - we make a list of why things won't work out - when contemplating whether or not to give love and new relationships a try. Quick and speedy, but refreshing all the same.

Surprise and Disbelief is the second story. It's also fast-paced, but requires a little more depth of concentration. It's a sort of coming-of-age story - the heroine keeps going back and forth between her first love and different guys before she makes up her mind. It's my least favourite of the stories, probably because I would've liked a little more on the story, and because I kept wondering what was wrong with the heroine.

Girl on a Hot Tin Roof was my favourite: I totally got it! Sometimes, you want to... just be! The story is about a young girl who has become a little more than overwhelmed by the male attention she's receiving from the construction workers across her street.

All in all, not a bad read, but would've preferred the last two stories to have a little more length.

I would recommend this book for persons looking for a light, witty, quick read.",0.9845,79.7,1

Admittedly, I'm a sucker for couples who have to wade through a shared past before they can come to terms with a future. And Rafe? He certainly had some lingering issues about himself and his likability. It took a while before he was convinced Clio really might want him for who he was.

Then there's Clio. She of the eight year engagement. I have to admit I found her family a little unbearable. Not her whole family. Just Daphne and her husband. I totally get why she put up with her sniping and such, but I spent the majority of their interactions waiting for Clio to snap and tell her off. To be fair, Clio's veneer of politeness was mighty thick and I knew it would take a while for her to find the backbone to step up and deal with Daphne. (Also to be fair, Daphne's sniping worked given what we were told about their mother and that her actions were the ones Daphne learned from.)

Meanwhile, Rafe and Clio together made me smile. His roughness against her polite breeding. His kisses....oh, his kisses. I really, REALLY liked those. Not to mention Clio's cake noises. Because a good cake totally deserves cake noises.

As far as sexual chemistry, Sky and Ford had it in spades. Every time they looked at one another they were either undressing each other with their eyes or bumping uglies like Jack rabbits. This book definitely didn't lack in the sex department. You were left with nothing less than pure blissful satisfaction, definitely no problem there.

Though Sky and Ford got off on the wrong foot in the beginning, you were able to see how there could be a connection between them once they started opening up to each other and realized they had quite a bit in common. I felt a bit torn because for me, their connection felt more rushed than natural.

Sadly that is kind of how I felt about Repair Me overall. The storyline was good but too much was happening too fast. Every time I would start to connect with the book and really get into it, another scenario was thrown at me to deal with but there wasn't enough time before the book ended for it to feel natural.

""It has nothing to do with that s*** - that's all accidental b. s - the s*** your born into that you can't f***in' control. ""
""Family, are the people who are there for you, who've got your back, and you know dam good and well, you've got theirs too! You don't just run away from them!""

Tuesday has some knowledge of Colts world but from a twisted dangerous point of view, he introduces her to a safe version of the world of BDSM, that has her wanting more. Along the way you learn how his bond with his brother Kash was formed, you learn how important trust can be and the lengths the brothers will go to, to protect their family. I've loved Colts journey so far and can't wait for his brother Kash' to begin.",0.9931,76.56,1

Tragic events following the 1916 Easter uprising sees the family at odds with each other and forced to move to London.
Young firebrand Danny is supporting the cause of an independent Ireland. This puts him at odds with his brother Patrick who decides to join the Royal navy. Jenny his spoiled sister finds herself penniless and forced to look for work. Her Fiance John, once a promising prospect, is arrested for his involvement in the uprising and imprisoned.
This book is meticulously researched and contains many period details that bring the story alive. The working conditions for the women in the munitions factories and the horrors of the battlefield are a brutal back ground that helped me feel a great deal of compassion for the family.
I especially liked the character of Jenny as she undergoes a complete transformation. She starts of as a spoiled and selfish girl, but through hardship her eyes gradually open and we see her grow into a confident, independent and intelligent young woman. The story ends in 1917 and as this is titled book 1, I hope that Ms Petken is already busy writing the follow up. There are turbulent times ahead for Ireland and Im sure well see Danny involved.

He leaves to discuss divorce settlements with his wife and Sheila just knows that she will not be able to do without the drugs while he is gone. Meanwhile checking the mail she finds a threatening letter.

Kindle_Store_5,5,0,"I first read Ernest Hemingway as a young college student and missed the depth in his simplicity. Reading him again has turned my opinion around. I urge you to read this book. In ""The Old Man and the Sea,"" he shows the story is not in the language per se, but in the complexity found in the subtle reality of life. Of course, ""Old Man,"" is not subtle in the classic sense. What I mean is that Hemingway doesn't labor the book with fantastic descriptions detailing the intricacies of the sea, or of being a fisherman. Instead, he delves into the mind of the old man, shows the fatherly love he has for a young boy, and the quest for his legacy. A quick read, I finished it in three or so hours. I was captured by the smell of the salt and the slippery feel of fish squirming in a net. I felt the thirst of a long night fighting a huge fish, and the burn of a fishing line running through my hands. I missed the young boy's company late on the boat, and also wished he were to help me fish. How Hemingway did do this to me?

As a Midwesterner, I have barely seen the sea, and have never really fished. It is a great book. Read it for the drama, the language, the psychology, the suspense. It is romance in the sense an old western novel is a romance. By all means, read it. I fully recommend ""The Old Man and the Sea"" by Ernest Hemingway. Anthony Trendl

This book may just be the total epitome of geekyness and I don't mean that in a bad way. It is obvious that the writer is completely in love with everything to do with this genre and the book is filled with references galore that the nerd in me reveled in at first although I must confess I preferred the earlier slightly less obvious mentions to the later ones that were quite blatent and at times I found myself lost in the ""What is that reference game"" which took me momentarily away from the focus of the story,

The book itself is split into 3 mini books each a little story within themselves. Personally I loved the first book the best and I wish that the author had carried along in that vein of thought but don't get me wrong the 2nd and 3rd books are good in their own way, they just have a different feel to them.

As the books progress the author moves you from ""almost"" reality, way into the depths of fantasy and he does it well although there are moments that felt a little forced or disjointed for me which is fairly common in newer writers.

Overall I would say if like me you are a fan of Epic Fantasy and would feel right at home in the middle of a comic con convention then this would be a good fit for you.

Feeling lost and in need of a girls night, she meets a handsome stranger in a bar. Warren turns out to be the spark she was missing in her life.

Ms. Reynolds has always been a go-to of mine when I'm in the mood for an alpha, but Nolan is by far the most possessive, protective, and yes, obsessed, alpha I've ever had the pleasure of meeting and Chloe is absolutely perfect for him.

Usually when I'm reading a novella I have a hard time feeling the connection between the hero and heroine but the connection between Nolan and Chloe was obvious from the first word. Yes, Nolan's an ass, and okay, maybe Chloe is a bit of a doormat, but who cares? It works for them, and it worked for me while I was reading it!

I love the whodunnit aspect of the story, but I love how that's not necessarily the main focus. The main focus totally being the smoking hot sexy times between Nolan and Chloe, of course! But I LOVE how they always end it with ""I Love You""... It adds the perfect amount of sweetness to counter balance the hotness.

My only complaint would be that I wish it were longer. And it would have been great to read from the beginning of their relationship, though even starting after they're already together I didn't really feel that we missed anything... That's just me being selfish and wanting more.

This is a great standalone story and book three in the series.  Book One introduced the concept of two worlds post war, divided by hidden portals. Cascadia is a world without technology or motorized vehicles and it citizens have paranormal abilities the Pacificans covet. For years the Pacifican Army has created crime waves they attribute to the Cascadians, giving them the reason they need for sustaining funding and support to continue their troop numbers.  They also seek out descendents of Cascadians living in Pacifica who have paranormal abilities and force them into the army. Those who refuse are incarcerated.  The more promising of these Talents are sent to a research lab, The Institute.  That is where Vince Crawford has been held for the past ten years, refusing to give up information about a portal he discovered that led him to Cascadia and Zara Kane, the girl he fell in love with.

Zara had just told Vince she was pregnant when he disappeared. Thinking he abandoned her, she is shocked to learn he has been imprisoned the whole time. Fiercely determined to free him, she convinces her brother to help and uses her cloaking Talent to get Vince away from his work detail and to a safe house. But neither of the lovers are the same people they were before Vince was taken. Their resulting story is one of bravery, love and patience in the face of Vince's PTSD and the force of the Pacifican Army intent on recapturing their most valuable prisoner.",0.9506,59.64,1

Grace Grainger is a journalist and a very good one.  She chooses to spend her time reporting on the lives of those who defend their country, living with them, much like her own tour of duty and is actually ""embedded"" into the team she is with.  Air Force Master Sergeant Josh Travers is a Pararescue Jumper and has done more than his share of tours overseas.  Both of them fantasize about the hot night they had with a stranger several years in the past, and both find themselves very surprised when in the heat of battle, the Pararescuer that comes to save the group Grace is with is the same hottie she got nasty with 3 years ago.

Thrown together in the middle of Afghanistan, the chemistry between these two is undeniably electric, despite the circumstances they find themselves in.  Then, there is the fact that Josh ""hates"" reporters, which presents a different problem.  The danger, drama, and romance in Dangerous Territory will keep you on the edge of your seat, while you fan your face from the heat that isn't even coming from the desert.

The Clue is a short book that is packed with information and then the beginning of a great story. The story begins with the main characters, Stephanie, and Tori. Stephanie is a teacher in her first year. She is a widow and has been engaged to a man named Henry since her husband died. They live in a small apartment on the edge of town, but all that changes when she finds out about his father's death. The story continues with Stephanie, Tori, Stephanie's best friend, and Stephanie's best friend. Stephanie is a recovering addict and is not sure if she will survive the ordeal of being in the hospital, or if she will be able to find a new life.

This is a good story with lots of information and with good characters. There are a few surprises along the way. I recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a good story that is not predictable. The characters are well developed, the story is well written and the plot is well written.

Kindle_Store_5,5,0,"This book is - in a word - emotional. It's beautiful and brutal, honest and raw. It's a coming of age story of self-discovery and learning what matters.

Dawn considers herself the outcast of her small beach community. She and her best friend Zeke since childhood, and the two are inseparable. They have an us against the world mentality, especially when it comes to the other kids their ages. Dawn is every teenage girl. She's trying to figure out who she is, who she wants to be, and what she wants out of life.

Shea moves in next door and immediately immerses herself into Dawn and Zekes world. She's different; free. A young girl with worldly knowledge beyond her years. But like a lot of free spirits, there's an underlying current running through them. Shea is an incredible character.

This book is hopeful and heartbreaking. I found myself more than one having to take a deep breath, clutching my e-reader to my chest, praying that what I thought was about to happen really wasn't going to. That's how well Lilliana wrote this story. You don't feel like you're reading a work of fiction, but rather that you're living it with them. Every scenario, every feeling, you are in. You feel right along with them. This isn't a lighthearted book, but that's not to say that there aren't lighthearted moments. And the supporting characters make the book very well rounded.

Best bits: Both Tess and Ryder had messed up birth parents, though Ryder was adopted into a loving home when he was 10 and Tess is still dealing with the aftermath of life with her crazy mother. Now, they both dedicate themselves to saving lives as EMTs. They're both good people, and both rather hung up on each other, though only Tess admits it to herself, and neither wants to mess up their friendship by being the first to move them towards romance. Definitely two very similar people, and once Ryder can get past his fear of losing someone he loves, they seem golden.

Issues: Plenty of typos and wrong words, as well as formatting errors with paragraph breaks happening where they shouldn't (especially in conversations, where it got really confusing as to who was talking at times) and not where they should. A handful of places where thoughts or memories really need to be set apart by italics. Not a fan of the ""quotes"" from characters that start each chapter (this time on separate pages before the chapters?). They feel forced and unnecessary. Some inconsistencies, like Tess's childhood first being described as constant movement from state to state as her mom switched boyfriends, but always after that she's described as having a hometown in NH that she was desperate to escape from.",0.9916,61.5,1

A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.
A robot must obey the orders given to it by human beings, except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.
A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Laws.

Although the author didn't state the Laws in the story she did refer to them.  In my opinion if they could break one, why couldn't they break another.  If so, then why did they need the mechanic.

Dunn is a space engineer that that goes from planet to planet for jobs.  He wakes up from hypersleep to handle his latest job, to fix the communications of a planet from which nothing has been heard for over twenty years.

I enjoyed the clear crisp writing, in the style of the early masters.  Up until the end, when I realized that the laws had been broken even though the author implied that the robots couldn't break the laws.  To be specific, the robots should not have been able to allow harm to come to any of the humans.

In addition, as to the last paragraph there was no foreshadowing or any support for what was happening.

So while I would love to read more by this author, I hope that she will stick to the rules she creates in her universe(s), or explain how/why they were broken or by-passed.

First Impression: Well-written, engaging, expertly executed, and FUN, a book after my heart. Chloe is a software analyst who works from home and only allows herself to truly experience lifeand sexwhen she goes to comic conventions, dressed in sexy cosplay costumes that give her the carefree confidence she lacks in her day to day life. She likes the role play a lot because she feels brave in the costumes, more in control of herself and her needs. It's at one of the conventions she goes to that she meets Grant Osprey and though they didn't share their real names, they did share a night together. A night Grant would like to repeat, despite the fact that his convention lover turns out to be his friend and business partner's little sister. Oops. I freaking loved this book! It's a quick, fast-paced read that immediately caught my attention and held me captive throughout my reading. Maybe it's the author's easy, seemingly effortless writing style, or maybe it's my own experiences with going to comic conventions and being amazed by all the costumes--a few of which my own niece has designed and worn, but I instantly fell in love with Chloe and Grant's story because I could relate to them on a very real scale.

Liz is every bit the warrior she was bred to be while Jack is the perfect seductive vampire. Both on the hunt for a mysterious creature that has been leaving a trail of bodies in it's wake. Working together is not something either of the main characters want. For starters, Liz hates Jack and when her friend discovers a way to increase Liz's power, more than doubling her strength and giving her the tools she needs to defeat whatever it is that is lurking and killing in the shadows of Boston, she is repulsed. But after facing the demon on her own, and taking beating, Liz admits, she needs the help and goes Jack with an interesting proposal. If they have sex, she can absorb his power and become strong enough to kill the demon.

For a short paranormal romance, this book has spice and striking characters. As expected for this type of book, the pace was quick and never dull. However, as I was reading I felt as if this was a second book rather than a first in the series. The world building was a little weak, not much background was given of the hunters or the vampires and there wasn't much of an explanation given for what Absinthe really even is.

I enjoy books about the corporate world, especially relationships involving an executive and a lower level employee. In Tracy Wolff's Addicted, CEO Ethan Frost and intern Chloe Girard are madly in love.  Actually, the word madly is an understatement, their love is completely all-consuming, and as a result they are unable to function when they are apart from each other.

After reading the dramatic prologue, I was hooked, at least for a little while. Some of the scenes are repetitive....Chloe running away almost every time she and Ethan have a problem, Ethan waiting for Chloe to come back to him, and Chloe's inability to cope with her past, to name a few. The story is good, what there is of it. A little less sex and a little more plot would have made the book more interesting.

Ethan is a likable character, albeit a bit tortured by his lack of pure common sense. He may be uber smart when it comes to business mergers, but when love is involved, he is downright simple. He does not learn from his mistakes because he makes the same poor choices over and over again. Chloe is an intelligent young woman, however, she is quite immature when it comes to being in a relationship.

I have always been so intrigued with Tarzan and Jane and I thought there certainly isn't any harm is downloading a freebie from Amazon.

I wasn't disappointed but I also wasn't thrilled either. I would bet if I read this story as a full length novel, I'd have liked it a whole bunch more. One of the reasons I despise serial books is because each book leaves off on a cliffhanger and you are forced to buy the next installment to read on. I really really reallllly hate that. It is such a turn off for me. I'd rather have spent $5 and got the entire book than a grabby grab for a continuous purchases. Oh well, I knew that going in so I shouldn't really complain. Good on the author for letting it been known in the book blurb that it is a serial book before you buy.

The writing was really good. Great descriptions. Easy to follow and even though it was a novella, I got to know the characters pretty fast. Since it is an erotic novella, there are a few great steamy scenes. Of course you have to read further into the series to get the smoking steamy scenes.

In the final installment to the Wilson Mooney Series, we finally get to know what happened in the epic cliffhanger of ""Eighteen At Last."" Wilson and Max are reeling from the last few days. Max, dealing with the death of his father and Wilson with the decisions she has made as a result of hurt feelings and misunderstandings.

The one thing that is hard for me to remember, even though Max is Wilson's teacher, he is still relatively young himself. Two young people dealing with a love so epic, there are bound to be major bumps in the road.

However, the one constant is their unquestionable love for one another. ""Beyond Eighteen"" delivers us the stunning conclusion while adding its own bit of drama for Max and Wilson. Before they an truly move on with their rest of their lives, Max must face what the death of his father means for his future when the conditions of the will come to light. Wilson must likewise finalize things with the death of her grandfather and figure out what the next steps will be with her mother.

Synopsis (from back cover): Jack the Ripper, sadistic madman of old London, once thought long dead, has returned to New York in an effort to quench his thirst for blood and mayhem. When the city's vampire enclave finds itself insufficient to deal with a madman of Jack's caliber, Vincent, the enclave head, enlists Leo Malone to put the maniac down before he reveals the existence of vampires as he throws the city into the throes of chaos and terror. Leo soon finds that Jack is not the only monster with which he must contend. A ghost from his past has also seemingly crawled from its grave and seeks to put an end to him and the rest of his kind.",-0.5992,67.49,1

 5 STAR REVIEW 

Pennie loved to read and that is why she was involved in her monthly book club. She was always comparing those book boyfriends she was reading about. Her social life was missing between her school work and her tight budget there was not much for her to do. But her life would change forever once she finds face to face with Carter, a woman that stop at anything to obtain what she wants. Carter was a business woman and she knew she had to be ruthless in her cut-throat world. When she finds herself with Pennie she knew she wanted to have her, protect her and love her in her own way. However there is a whole lot of issues they will have to face in order for her to be happy with Pennie. Carter and Pennie don't have the conventional relationship, but they know they are good for each other but how far will they are willing to go to achieve their happily ever after?

Well let me tell something this is my first F/F romance and I was surprised how this book had so much to offer. The plot had you sucked in and you will want to read the whole book before you put it down. This book will show you the lengths someone is willing to go for the person they love and no matter how you get there the only thing matters is how you will take it from that point on. I love this book and I will recommend for everyone to read this book. Gifted by author in exchange for an honest review. https://www. facebook.",0.994,83.7,1
Kindle_Store_5,5,0,"Dorian Devil is the type of character you want to know more about the further his story develops. In Venice, we are introduces to parts of Dorian that were not provided in the first book Denver. We get to see why he seems like a jerk one moment and a nice guy the next. The poor guy was being gunned for by his own family. Who wouldn't be a little emotionally scarred from that? On top of that, in this second installment of The Enchanter, the hunters are attempting to wipe out an entire city's paranormal population; and Dorian recognizes the magic involved - you guessed it, family. The only way to stop it is to try and get the entire city to work together, but that is like herding cats, literally and figuratively, maybe. If the spell Dorian used in this book was real, I would be the first in line to purchase it, because who wouldn't like to loose a few pounds and never see them come back? Especially if it helped a guy like him?
I love this series and the characters that we are being introduced to. I cannot wait to see what is next for Dorian. I am waiting on pins and needles to see who, or maybe what Mikas is to him and how Dorian's apprentice is.

This is a short story with a lot of sexual tension.  The story is told in two parts.  The first part is a fast paced story.  The second part is a more mature story.  I liked it a lot.  The story is told from the POV of the main character, Luke, who is a vampire hunter.  The sex scenes are very hot.  I liked that the main character, Luke, was a bit of a jerk, but it didn't bother me that he had a big heart.  The story was a bit different from the first book in the series.  I will be reading the first book in the series.

Kindle_Store_5,2,0,"It was so freaking long! There was just too much detail and I really didn't need to know every move they made every day. Very flowery, sappy dialogue was used a lot. I disliked Chase's prejudiced generalization that bisexual men are predisposed to cheat because they are attracted to both sexes. Cheaters are predisposed to cheat and it has nothing to do with sexuality. And he had that viewpoint prior to the boyfriend that cheated with a woman.

I also disliked the fact that Gray spent 10 years with Devon and dismissed it all so casually. Devon should never have cheated and never should have stayed if their relationship was so bad for 4 whole years. Maybe he was as manipulative as he was depicted. But Gray should be blamed as well, when he was the one avoiding intimacy and was too lazy and too complacent to make a clean break. Also, later in the book, he said he owned his house before Devon and Devon only lived there for a year. After 10 years together? That makes no sense.

I know that much of the story was introducing characters for future stories and I liked some of them. I did make it through the whole story but it was a chore. I never connected with the characters. They both seemed immature in many ways. Their little breakup was ridiculous and was no more than a setup for another long sappy make up scene. Added nothing to the book. So I might read the next book because of other characters but only if they're written more cleanly and with less syrupy dialogue.",-0.9794,74.59,1
Kindle_Store_5,5,0,"I've read a lot of new adult romance books lately, so I've seen how a lot of them are the same, or how they differ.  I think anyone who reads a lot will kind of fall into that trap sometimes.  We always want something similar, but... not too much, you know?  To recapture that feeling that we had while reading something else, but to get a sense of more and a feeling of excitement, too.

This book is definitely that.  Right from the start, the entire thing catches you.  I honestly didn't expect what I was reading, but I liked it.  Caught and roped in, basically, and I wanted more.

Hopelessly Broken definitely provides more, too.  There's a lot going on in this book.  The characters are interesting and realistic.  I really enjoyed reading about Aeron especially.  I don't know that I've seen any character quite like him in another book.  Jenn's struggles are oftentimes something I think a lot of us can relate to, also.  Maybe not exactly, but the ideas and concepts behind them, you know?  I don't want to give too much away, but for a book like this to be as realistic was it was, I was impressed with how Tawny Taylor went about it.

One warning is that there's apparently another one planned for the future, so you're definitely going to want to keep an eye out for that.  Hopelessly Broken is on the longer side, though, so it's definitely really satisfying on its own.  I can't wait to read the second part!",0.9848,75.3,1

This book starts off with Vaughn in the hospital, hell bent on finding Lark, who has stolen something that is very precious to him.  It is immediately apparant that these two have a history (which may have been revealed in the other books that I haven't read yet).  Once Vaughn is healed he sets out to find the elusive woman that stole not only property from him, but his heart as well.

Lark is on the run from her past.  No one knows who she truly is and she can't let anyone ever find out or else she is a dead woman.  Running has recently become harder after he last stop.  Not only did she make some really good friends but she went and fell in love as well.  That is how she knew it was time to move on, she promised never to let herself get too attached to anyone ever again.

With the help of his brother and a few close friends Vaughn is able to track lark down.  However, things aren't exactly as they appear and once he finds out who Lark really is there is nothing he won't do to protect the woman he loves and bring her back home where she belongs.

The Nameless Dwarf Omnibus contains the first three stories following the dwarf known only as Nameless.  If you have read some of Derek's other work than you may be familiar with him as he has been a companion of Shadrak the Unseen and Deacon Shader.

The book starts out with Nameless being a very mysterious figure who has hired a boy from the Night Hawks (a criminal group) to help him find information on where his people have fled to.  Nils, his companion, is the son of the leader of the guild out to prove his worth as a man.  During the journey they meet up with Silas, a magic user, who is studying the stolen grimoire of the Liche Lord Otto Blightey.  At the end of Ant-Man Ilesa joins up with the group as well.  She is a woman who seems to have some level of skill with shapeshifting/illusion magic.  As the stories progress the characters true natures are revealed as their stories are unraveled.  Derek has done a wonderful job keeping the main story on point while gradually revealing the backgrounds of all the people involved.

The book starts out with a lot of information and someone who is unfamiliar with the world Derek has created might struggle a bit at first.  As the book progresses everything comes together beautifully and by the end I didn't want to stop reading for any reason.  I will also be checking out the next story in the series, The Ebon Staff as soon as possible to see what will happen.

There where times I did go out to Google to research some of the mythology mentioned in the book to round out the reading for my self-need but it is not necessary for the reader to do that in order to enjoy this book.

The author creates a very interesting world involving mythology and a large variety of complex characters drawing the reader deep into her fantasy world. Readers will be curious with the plaything, Damon and his story while wondering who he really is. As the story unwinds who he is becomes clearer and you will have that ""AH HA"" moment and feel at peace with him and his story.

Meanwhile Elysia, another aspect of this story, continues to draw your attention in another direction worth investigating. Elysia is a great example of how a woman would handle life threatening situations when there is no choice but to live. Her believable character will draw the reader closer with the desire to see her succeed and get her hearts desires.

Secondary characters are numerous and the reader will be able to tell that their stories were written in previous books to this series but this will not be a problem to reading this book.

With no place to go she begrudgingly takes him up on his offer to crash at his place for a short while. It doesn't hurt that he is OFF THE CHARTS HAWT!!!!

Colt is instantly enamored with the vixen on two wheels and jumps at the chance to be her (paraphrasing book) knight in a leather cut riding in on his black hog to save her. The love/lust is kinda insta-lust that grows into some deep feelings fast and the sex is raunchy and will melt your undies right-off.

Despite the romantic aspect there is an undercurrent of subterfuge and suspense and the book ends on a cliffhanger in anticipation of the next book, Pleasure & Pain: Inferno Glory MC #2. I thoroughly enjoyed this quick read and can't wait to see what's going to happen next!",-0.7859,80.41,1

Kindle_Store_5,4,0,"If you haven't read anything in the Wine of the Gods series...book 18 is not a good place to start.  I really like this universe (multiverse?), but there are so many characters and so much about the world(s) that is hinted at it becomes a bit overwhelming.  Unless you have read the whole series and have the background.

That being said, for those of you who are fans this adds a wonderful new group of magic users to the mix.  Having some new blood to add to the already defined groups should shake things up nicely.  We also see more action by mage compass's, which is a nice change from the usual witches pyramids.  Some of the first hints of a coming tech/magic revolution that may make the industrial revolution look like a minor upgrade.  A whole new pyramid also is peeking around the edges.

Now for the bad:  Much as I like this world ^and^ the writing, this is not a good short story.  This is more of a chronology of what happened.  While some of the characters learned new skills or information, we did not.  More about filling in the blanks and backstory than developing a character.

There is a teaser at the end of the book showing the next(?) in the series that gives me a lot of hope.  The Sea Kings!!  An almost unexplored area.

I did feel sorry for the Hero who was cheated out of 10 years of his son's life.  He was 2 years older than her and she was a college graduate, so he had to be around 25 or so.  I think in his drunken state he was just popping off more than he really meant the words he said.  I realize to make the story work she had to run.

She did make a lot of dumb choices and she did seem very immature and weak when she was suppose to be such a strong character.  I could almost deal with all of that.  What got on my last nerve, and SPOILER here, was her insecurities.  Good grief, what does a guy have to do to convince you he means what he says.  She did take responsibility for some of her bad choices so I will give her that.  She was rather annoying and not a heroine that inspired a lot of affection.  Seems he was made to grovel and she was the one that ran rather than staying and discussing things with him.  But, this is one of those stories you need to read for yourself.

He's the MMA heavyweight champion, capable of inflicting serious damage. His strength of character is as strong as his muscle. When Chase witnesses a heated discussion between Avery and another MMA fighter who wants to be more than friends and sees Avery get pushed against the concrete wall so hard you can hear her head hit it from over 10 feet away, Chase intervenes, telling the guy point blank YOU NEVER HIT A WOMAN. After the threat to Avery is removed, Chase watches over and tends to Avery, ensuring she gets the care she needs.

Kindle_Store_5,5,0,"This is my first book by this author, so I didn't really know what to expect. I found the beginning of the story a little bit hard to get into - not because it was badly written, but because of the subject matter that it covers. Cassie, the heroine, suffers a traumatic event that will shape the rest of her life. How she deals with this affects not only herself but those around her. The event is not allowed to rest though, the perpetrator come back to haunt her.

Once the story moves into the present day, it became a wonderful, emotional and gripping story. One that certainly lives up to the term ""a real page turner"". Cassie meets her one and only love, her soul mate in Jordan - their story together is simply beautiful. But due to decisions she makes, Cassie loses eveything, causing not only her life to be affected, but Jordan's as well.

They say that separation makes the heart grow fonder - for Cassie this is so true. Jordan is never far from her mind or her heart. He loves her and he also has the ability to give her the strength that she needs. The heartbreak that this woman suffers is devastating, but it is one which gives her strength to deal with all adversity.

This story is amazing, an emotional rollercoaster that will draw you in. The characters that Krissy V has written were superb - they are one that will live in your heart and mind for a long time after the book is finished and put down.

A highly recommended read.

Kindle_Store_5,3,0,"A romantic mystery with a touch of suspense.

An Opportunity Seized caught my attention with its name. I immediately thought that this was a workplace/office mystery. After reading the book I am still not sure what the title has to do with the story.

Toni is an heiress, the daughter of a mining magnate, who just wants to be normal whereas Jason is ex-military and co-owner of Haven Security. Jason is the bodyguard hired by Tonis father.

While guarding her he develops feelings for her. She falls for him, too. A relationship that was almost impossible to begin with is tested when a mining accident threatens the whole family.

One thing I liked about the relationship was that though both of them were immensely attracted to each other, they also get to know each other on a deeper level than just chemistry. This part of their relationship is shown clearly after the mining accident.

Readers who enjoy frequent sex will be pleased with this short story. It wasn't the hard core erotic variety but there is enough to make a reader who isn't used to reading it to possibly become either uncomfortable or start blushing like crazy.

That being said this is still a mystery. I think the beginning was a little slower than the ending. The ending seemed a little fast paced, which I loved.

This is a romantic mystery, heavy on the sexual elements. It worked for me because there was enough of the mystery plot to offset some of the romance.

The ending was a full of surprises. The twists and turns and the new information that were revealed kept me reading to the very end.

Deputy Shawna Mallory is a thirty-one year old single cop who lives in the rather sleepy town of Carlton Grove. She has a deep commitment to her job, and moves quickly when she hears an amber alert on the radio for a missing eleven year old boy. Mallory hears a dog barking; she finds the boy under a snow drift being guarded by the pup. The sheriff agrees to take the boy in while he awaits a new foster care family.

Complications arise when the boy's real father arrives back on the scene from an overseas assignment in Chile.

I admit, that I was a little confused at first. The person who wrote the ""Single Guy"" column, was he Matthew Rhodes, or Ryan, or were they the same guy?  After I figured that out, it was pretty smooth sailing.

Ryan's column was a somewhat cynical view of Love, and the column Mia wrote, ""Lonely Girl"", was more about single women navigating the dating scene. When Ryan and Mia first met, they each had no idea they were with the person behind the column. Their focus was on the 'reality' of Love as they saw it.

They had great chemistry going until Mia figured out that Ryan was Lonely Guy and bolted. They both end up on a Bachelor type dating show as contestants. They each have their own agenda for appearing, and it is not to fall in love. Both Ryan and Mia were shocked to find out they were both going to be on the show.  I did love their back and forth teasing and wittiness in their conversations.

One not believing in love. The other feeling unlovable. There was blackmail, corruption, deceit, manipulation, love, loyalty, and family throught this book. Let's not forget a few steamy sex scenes. There is a HEA, no worries there.

This was a fun, romance read. My only regret was there was no detail on Mia's boss ever getting what was coming to her. I also wasn't 100% sure if Ryan got to write the article that he really wanted to and use some of the information against Mia's boss. I was left wanting more.

Kindle_Store_5,5,0,"Going Against Type by Sharon Black (click here for Author Wednesday guest post) went toward my type of delightful light-hearted contemporary romance set in Dublin, Ireland. The genre hearkens back to the 1950s with mismatched lovers such as Katherine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy, albeit with Irish eyes and tastes.

Charlotte ""Charlie"" Regan yearns to find her place in a world dominated by men as a sports' reporter and columnist. The hero of the story also fights for his place in the world of fashion writing where men are in short supply. It doesn't help matters that they work for harshly competitive newspapers and somehow find themselves pitted against one another when Charlie steps into the world of fashion by criticizing the footballers of Ireland for advertising popular name brands.

The novel reverberates with authenticity of the life of a journalist always under pressure to be fast, accurate, and edgy. Ms. Black, herself a journalist, paints a realistic picture of both Charlie and Derry despite their opposite views. I liked the twist in the story that turned stereotypes on end. It reminded me a bit of the movie with Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks, You've Got Mail. For most of the novel, neither Charlie nor Derry know the other one is the author behind the viperous attacks in the two rival columns written anonymously. In the meantime, they begin dating, enjoying their time together more each time.

If you want to escape for a few hours into the world of Irish football, fashion, and foibles, you won't be disappointed with Going Against Type. I think it's the first Irish novel I've read that wasn't historical, which makes it both refreshing and light.",0.9717,58.01,1

Until she sees Dylan, who makes her rethink a few things, but she has to be careful or she could be fired: on-board romances are frowned upon.

Ill put is simply: THE BOSS AND HER BILLIONAIRE is excellent! Its so very well written; Ms. DeWintons prose is very expressive, flowing and so easy to read. THE BOSS AND HER BILLIONAIRE really made me want to go on such a cruise: the author describes the ship and the setting  Australia and New Zealand  so well, I felt I was there. I also love how Ms. DeWinton portrays the dance environment and the performers; that was a lot of fun. Dylan and Michaela are both such fabulous characters.

Dylan is seductive and charming, but not aggressive; still he decides Michaela will relax even if it kills him. The chemistry between Michaela and Dylan is sizzling and feels very real.

I really enjoyed this book. It was not the best I've read in a while. There was a lot of action, and a little bit of romance in it. There was also some sex. There was also a bit of a cliff hanger, and I'm not sure if it was due to the ending or because I didn't want to put the book down.

The book starts over in America with Alicia discovering her cheating husband and then escaping over here to make a fresh start. She moves to Auckland where she has an IT job and moves next door to Tia, Hunter and Mick. What I liked about Alicia is that she is quite naive and this made her character funny and made her more relatable. As the book goes along we read as Hunter and Alicia start gaining great chemistry and though neither is officially ready for a relationship, they both seem to work great together and they get all hot and heavy. If you love Second Chance New Adult romances, then this is the book for you. The only thing I didn't like about this book was the language as being from New Zealand , I am used to how we do things here and our language. The author used phrases like Kia Ora as hello since the character next door was Maori and the word Pakeha and tribe. I know often it can be difficult for American writers to grasp the different cultural differences and language.

A broad shoulder, covered in dark blue, entered her line of vision. Then a crop of longish, wavy hair. Just as the man angled his back to the door to close it
Womp! Not one to sport violent tendencies, she lowered the spoon with all the force of a pillow fight.
Owe! What the!
Startled blue eyes rounded on her. Apples and oranges skipped off the top of the brown paper sack and went flying across the floor. Shock, pain and aggravation crossed the mans features. His strong jaw clenched as if he fought against retaliation and she supposed, a string of cuss words.
He tumbled toward the sofa and lowered the bags in one smooth motion. He grabbed his right shoulder and winced. What the hell, lady. Who are you?-

Kindle_Store_5,4,0,"When Cass Stone and Logan Alexander meet, it's not love at first sight. Both pretending to be someone that they're not, neither Cass nor Logan was looking for more than a fun night, with no strings, then they'd go their separate ways. Funny how things never go as planned.

Fast forward two years. Cass is an independent successful woman, striving to be taken seriously in a field dominated by men. Life has not turned out exactly as she'd expected, but she is smart and secure enough in herself and her goals to roll with the changes that life has thrown her way. Finding herself a single mom, she has more than risen to the occasion, and is raising Olivia with the love that she never experienced in her own childhood.

While Logan has spent the last two years dedicated to his job, he hasn't ever forgotten that night with Cass. When the two meet again, it's like the sexual tension has been simmering under the surface, and like they haven't been apart at all. Finding out that Cass (or Miss Mary, as he calls her; seriously sexy!) and he have a daughter rocks his world. Even though he is angry that she's kept Olivia from him (or so he thinks), he can't fight the attraction for Cass that's still as strong as ever.

I thoroughly enjoyed this book. There is humor, intrigue (it's a spy story, after all!), passion, and so much love. The characters are well-developed and likeable, the kind of people that you absolutely want to hang out with. Paula Altenburg has written a book that drew me in and kept me reading, and I look forward to reading more from her.",0.9733,79.9,1

Overall, it was a good read and a short story. It was a good read. This was a good story, but I did have a few issues with the writing. I don't think I've read a book that has a relationship between the two main characters, but I did find that I could relate to both of them. I was just not very happy with the way the book ended. It felt like the main character was trying to make her way back to her life, and the story ended abruptly. I was hoping that the author would have a more happy ending, but I didn't feel it.

I found West simply irresistible, the combination of hot, handsome, well-intentioned neighbor struggling with awkwardly emerging lover along with a heroine who stars in this story for much more than her beauty was perfect. The love that grew between West and Annie reminded me of what my mother told me about love - when a man says he loves you when you look your best, it's a compliment, when he says it in the garden and you're covered in dirt, it's a declaration! In this story you also get a second romance, a mix-up on engagements, and a really nasty villain! Another thing I liked about this story was the strong female friendships that are too seldom found in literature. This story was well written and the story flowed well. The imagery was exceptionally well done; I could practically see, hear, smell, and especially taste the dust behind the cattle. The only false note in the story was Clara. I felt her hesitation about setting a wedding date didn't fit her character and her indecision about marrying West when she had feelings for Jones just plain felt wrong to me. That's why I gave this story four stars instead of five but even with this one flaw, it's still a very enjoyable romance with some graphic lovemaking but no vulgar language. (The reason I said ""lovemaking"" is there is nothing more than passionate kissing until West and Annie are engaged. ) For anyone looking for a historical western romance that makes you give a big smile at the HEA ending, then I definitely recommend this one.",0.9944,64.75,1

Kindle_Store_5,3,0,"Sky High was a short and sweet read but it didn't exactly deliver all that I expected it to.

Some books that I have read make every character seem important no matter how trivial their role was, but this book wasn't one of them. While reading this book, a lot of times I thought that a character wasn't a significant part of the book and this didn't just happen during the book, It also happened after I had finished it. I kept thinking about the book and all of the characters inside it and they just didn't seem important enough even though I know they were.

What Im trying to say here is that, in my opinion, this book lacked some sort of execution or finesse that could have taken it from being just another good book to an amazing one. I never for one second doubt that C.J. Lake holds talent for story writing but all Im saying is that it needs a little bit more work.

Other than that, the story was sweet, romantic and also quite hot. Even though a lot of characters appeared to be minor, I did love the main characters and the chemistry between those two. The relationship between those two was something to envy. Their banter, their romance, their attraction toward one another was extremely enjoyable to read.

In the end, I wouldnt say that reading this book was a waste of my time but I also won't be reading it a second time. Nevertheless, I will be reading other works of C.J. Lake to look for better versions of Sky High. And when I read one like that, let me tell you well have a winner on our hands.",0.9941,77.47,1
Kindle_Store_5,5,0,"This novel is so real.  There is nothing farfetched or out of this world that happens.  Everything is completely plausible and even probable.  The story itself is emotional and heartfelt.  It is in essence a story about overcoming the worst of hardships, yet it is so much more.  Harrisons understated, mellow, yet still vivid descriptions craw you into the world that shes created.  Her use of the real as opposed to the worst case scenario makes it easy to relate to, thus incorporate yourself into, the story.  I definitely feel like Ive set foot in Oz after reading this tale.

The characters were amazing as well.  I really appreciate how strong and independent the main character was.  She also was less than perfect, allowing readers to relate to her on a personal level, because you do get to know her quite well.  The supporting cast in this novel is divided into 2 groups:  those who are verging on main character status and those who help propel the story forward.  The first group are extremely well developed, becoming individuals that you feel youve met in the real world.  The second group has a range of development that pertains directly to their role in the story.  Overall, Harrison has created a brilliant cast to carry her story forward.

Final thoughts?  I definitely cant wait to dig into more by this talented author.  However, I must say that I was dying for an Aussie Shiraz by then end of the novel.  Be warned!

While I read the first two books, I didn't really care for the rest of the story. The first one was really good, but the second one was really bad. There was no real story to it.

I did get a little frustrated with the hero and heroine, but I didn't really care about them. I think that they were all just a bunch of idiots.

I really liked the hero, and I really liked the heroine. She was a strong heroine who had a lot of issues. She was a bit naive at the beginning, but she grew on me as the book progressed.

I really liked the villain, and he was a good guy. He was a bit of a jerk, but I didn't care about him.

I really liked the ending. I was hoping that there would be a sequel. It didn't really happen.

I did like the other characters, but I didn't like the ending. I would have liked to have had more characters.

The girl that was kidnapped in the first book is now back with her family and working in a The Charcoal grill.

Is she over her experience? Is she heck. Its left her with a few scars, emotional. There is a reference in there to a phrase, it is reflecting how a human can harbor a beast, a wolf, everyone has hidden nasty tendencies, well, this is what I took away from it.

The guy who own the Charcoal grill is a bit of a perv, he doesn't care who sees him watching dirty sexual video's on his PC, no matter who walks in. However, the other side of him makes advances to his staff. He justifies this because the small town doesn't have that many jobs, so who can leave? Who can complain? Who can afford to loose they're job?

She is safe though, as she has an important father!

We have a death of Zoe. Then we have a death of another girl, both deaths a carbon copy of each other although the time zone in between is distance.

Getting into the mind of a certain character in the book was weird, eerie and creepy.

I just don't want to give the game away in this book 2 as its so cleverly written and I don't believe in spoilers.

I have to say........the conclusion of this book has left it WIDE OPEN and its not the usual cliff hanger in a book, but it has its GASPING factor.

Kindle_Store_5,3,0,"I have mixed feelings about this book.  At times I loved it; other times I threw it across the room.  The information on writing reviews, Listmania, and So You'd Like To...Guides was extremely valuable.  Knowing how Amazon uses this information to get more exposure for your book is worth the price of the book.

But there were a lot of questions that remained unanswered.  Author Connect was somewhat confusing.  I asked quite a few people to access an author's profile page and no one succeeded. Amazon customers will follow the path of least resistance. If these are so well hidden that Brent has to give you a web address to put in to find it, how are the readers supposed to uncover this ""useful"" information?  They won't.  I understand that isn't the Brent's fault, but why should I spend my time doing something potential buyers can't find, even if it's free!

Buy X Get Y could have been more detailed.  There is more to pairing books than selecting a title.  Is it worthwhile to pair your book with a top selling title that has a one or a two-star review as a Spotlight Review?  What if the title you select is in the top 10 in sales, but sells for 1/2 the price of yours?  Is it a good match?  I don't expect Brent to do all the work, but I do feel these are valid questions that should have been addressed.

Kindle_Store_5,4,0,"Why I Picked It Up
By now you can deduce that I am interested in any book that involves musicians. So of course I had to pick this one up, especially considering the fact that it hinted at a best friends romance.

Plot

It was that and more. The story of Chloe and Noah was complicated to say the least and it hooked me in. Seeing their struggles, seeing the two of them fighting their attraction, and trying to live life in the spotlight kept me engaged from the very beginning.

Leading Lady

Chloe was a great character. She cared for Noah. She was excited to get a new start. She was happy and determined. On the other hand, she had a backbone and didn't take crap from anyone, especially her ex or Noah's ex.

Leading Male

Noah was sweet, talented, and humble which you don't find in many of the musician characters in novels nowadays. I absolutely fell in love with him and his charms.

Romance

I liked the way that Wicks evolved this plot. I loved seeing a bit of the back-story of the two characters, both individually and together. It really gave their relationship depth. Their relationship was fun with, of course, some drama. I loved the tension between the two of them for the first half of the novel. I enjoyed how their relationship grew more and more. And of course, I adored the fact that they were friends first and foremost. They were perfect for each other and complimented each other very well. I hope we see some of them in the companion novel.

Jag and Roxy are definitely a unique couple. They started out basically hating each other (or close to it) and it basically boiled down to several chance meetings where they poked at each other. This was extremely amusing to read about. Jag has serious drug problems and unfortunately a huge part of that is is rock career and the people in it that put a lot of pressure on him. Not to mention his ex-girlfriend from before he became famous. Roxy grew up with a drug dealer father and brother who OD'd so she's seen that side of things and wants nothing to do with it. She turns out to be Jag's saving grace and the light at the end of the tunnel so to speak. Despite all their personal problems, they truly are a fantastic couple.

Kindle_Store_5,4,0,"This review is also posted on my blog: theshortreviewer.blogspot.com

I normally enjoy stories that are told through the viewpoint of someone you can feel for--you know, a good guy or girl. Being that I knew this story would be told through the eyes of someone truly evil, then I got past that and found myself both intrigued and utterly disgusted at the same time. I do like a good disturbing thriller after all. And this book certainly delivered on that.

Fearlessly written, the author holds absolutely nothing back. This is not an exaggeration. The main character is a serial killer, and you are taken into his sick and twisted mind. The repetitiveness of his thoughts is indicative of how I believe someone like him would think. I had no empathy for this character at all. I found myself hoping this was fiction and not an autobiography in disguise! That is how good of a job the author does with bringing you inside this psycho's demented world.

The story is graphic, and many of the scenes are deeply horrifying and troubling. And what is even more terrifying is that there are people out there who do commit atrocious crimes such as this. So even though this is fiction, it is probably more realistic than most of us would like to believe.

It often read more like a diary, where the killer tells a lot of his story, and the dialogue is limited. It was a short, quick read, and I do sincerely hope for a sequel. The story did not feel finished as there is definitely more to be told here.

I recommend this for anyone who thinks they can take it for what it is - a messed up and gritty story.",-0.4469,72.87,1

As much as the anthropomorphized animal aspects might be weird -- my wife, for example, was a little squicked by it -- it actually served as an interesting proxy for our own history of racial slavery in the U.S.  In many cases I could see people treating the rabbits in much the way old slaveholders of the U.S. south would have treated them, and I also see what that slavery has done to the rabbits psyche, in terms of their expectations, their choices, and their self-image.  More than any furry aspect, it was this comfortable view of slavery that got under my skin more than anything else.

So, this book takes David from his injuries through to his official decoration for his heroic actions in the first book, and then onto the navy's officer academy with the Kings full blessing.  Of course, not everyone wants to see David succeed as the first free rabbit to enter the academy, and there's quite a bit of good struggle over that.  Along the way, he befriends a few other students in the academy, and for the climax, they go to an interstellar wargames competition between two opposing academies.  He acquits himself fairly well in a move that would have made even Ender Wiggin proud.

I loved this book! It was a great read.  I had a lot of fun with the characters and the storyline.  This book had a lot of fun in it's own way.  This book is a great series for adults and teens.  I look forward to reading more books by this author.

Kindle_Store_5,5,0,"The Brothers are the authors of childrens books that are as entertaining (and of educational) for adults who read to their children as well!  This is a new series by The Brothers is a learning tool as well as an entertaining well illustrated with photographs book for youngsters who are curious. It is meant to be shared, a starting point for parent/child interaction in learning and opening the field for questions.

This book deals with the number 2  and to give an example of how the book is constructed, the first page starts with a photograph of adult hands holding baby feet. The wording is We have only two hands, two feet, two eyes, two ears
Did you know that? There are 27 bones in the human hand and that only apes hands have a similar structure. Picture, facts, and then further information make this a very interesting format.

Some of the other 2 pages present eyes, sets of teeth, genders (the note courageously mentions the combo  hermaphrodite), two names for autumn, two political parties, sides of a coin, two kinds of pandas, number of humps on a camel, the two World Wars, two million flowers for a bee to make one pound of honey, number of days humans can survive without drinking, number of muscles in a cats ear = thirty TWO, and so forth. The amount of information begins at an (hopefully) obvious level and then disseminates into all manner of topics as the above list suggests. As The Brothers say, Read it the book to your children, speak to them about it and explain it to them. This is one of the more creative and fun books for families. Highly Recommended.

Oh my gosh I love Solease Barners The draglen Brothers Series, they are just too darn amazing foreal.  When I finished Gemi I was like oh gosh I need more and more of those darn dragon brothers.  Solease has always kept our attention with each of the draglen brothers each story is always different, and each characters posses their own unique characteristics and dispositions in the book. We are onto the fourth brother who is Gemi. Unlike the other brothers who really weren't searching for a Wella, he has longed for mate to be his other half, the one who is destined to be his.  While in New Orleans he comes across the one person who is his and only his; Shalisi.  Shalisi is not your typical woman, though she is sweet, sexy there is one tiny problem in this possible romance... she is a witch and one of the dragons most mortal enemy. Her destiny is to become a Passer but she must make a difficult decision whether to leave her coven and true calling behind or to be with the dragon who makes her feel, and long for more.  I loved this book oh my gosh im not gonna lie between all of the draglen books this one was by far my most favorite.

Kindle_Store_5,5,0,"I was given an ARC copy of this to read and review by the author, however I enjoyed it so much I purchased a copy for myself.

This is book two in this new series by Georgette, however it can be read as a standalone. There are brief appearances from the first couple in the series so while it works on its own, I would suggest reading the first book anyway.

Cadence is half werewolf, half dragon. She never knew her father and was raised by her mother with no impact from her father or his family. Since her wolf was most dominant she was able to hide that she was half dragon, however she is changing. Her wolf is gone and her dragon side is beginning to take over. She is unable to hide it any longer and since dragon births are on the decline, she has no choice but to register and subject herself to a forced mating with a complete stranger. However fate was at work when her best friend, Daisy, happened to meet a dragon as he was being ejected by her aunts mating agency. Some quick thinking gets them both in the same room and that is where the real fun begins.

I love this world Georgette has created as well as the two sides to the dragons. The ice dragons and the fire dragons and the war that has always been simmering between them is so interesting. Cadence is an ice dragon and Orion is a fire dragon. They should hate each other, not be falling in love.

Kindle_Store_5,4,0,"I love sports romance, but hockey romance is by far my favorite! I now have read all seven of these fabulous Carolina Cold Fury Hockey romances and I have loved them all for different reasons. They all have different types of twists to each of them. Now I have a new favorite, Roman! I loved it and flew through the pages!

I am not going to rehash the story for you as the synopsis gives you a good set up of what the book is about. There is drama. there are steamy love scenes between Lexi and Roman, but it is a slow build with lots of flirting and innuendos and they are so sweet together. It is wonderful to see how their growing infatuation turns into a deep caring relationship.

The new twist to this book is there is a concurrent love story developing between Brian Brannon (Lexis father that she recently found out about from her dying mother) and Lexis free spirited boss Georgia! Lets just say Georgia really knew how to loosen up that stuck-up suit! Another twist is the family dynamics between Brian, Lexi and her half-sister, Gray. Gray had a hard time adjusting to the idea of sharing her father (Brian). Gray, as general manager of the Cold Fury, had issues with Roman and his personal and professional trouble making ways. Roman didn't like her management style, so they agreed to disagree and their disdain for one another put Lexi in a bad position; choose between her new family or the man she was falling in love with.

Designation: Standalone, 302 pages

Nicolette Hugo is a new author for me and she is one I will be looking for in the future.

The blurb is very accurate, but it really only tells part of the story.  We begin with Killian Bailey trying to rescue his wife who has been kidnapped by the cartel. He saves her, but not before she is permanently harmed.  Killian is also scarred by his failure and puts all his effort into getting revenge on the man who took her.

Although, Scarlet Bailey loves her husband she misses their intimacy since he is punishing himself for failing to protect her so she calls on Jerricho Black, Dom for hire.  Once Killian finds out, he hires Jerricho for 40 days.

So this is quite a complicated plot.  At times it seemed a bit choppy or maybe it was just because there were a few different stories going on.  I really enjoyed the dynamics between Scarlet, Jerricho and Killian.  Jerricho definitely had a complicated past and then the relationship between Scarlet and Killian was unique.  A few times I wanted them to just say what they wanted.  It was one of those books where no one was willing to admit what they wanted and they each thought that what they were doing was protecting the others. Overall we did get an HEA although not a full epilogue.  I still want more.maybe a book 2.

There was also the excerpt from Exhibition at the end which was very intriguing and is now cued on my Kindle.

Frank is busy with his job as an accountant. He is very methodical. He thinks things are fine between him and his wife, but mostly because he has stopped paying attention. He finds himself masturbating nearly every day, afraid of burdening his wife with his carnal needs.

Wendy is a stay at home mother of three rambunctious boys. She loves her husband, but finds that he no longer satisfies her in the bedroom. She has immersed herself in the erotic novels on her Kindle. The dominant book boyfriends provide her with plenty of masturbatory fantasies to get her through the day. Her BOB (battery operated boyfriend) is her best friend.

Things change when Frank accidentally takes his wife's Kindle to work with him by mistake. He discovers the erotic world that his wife has been visiting, and he realizes for the first time that things may not be as okay as he thought they were.

Frank, using his analytical accountant mind, begins to read, research and analyze the books his wife has been fascinated by. He learns all about BDSM, and dominant/submissive role play. He even joins Fetlife, an online message board for those in the lifestyle. He learns all he can, and he is determined to become the dominant man his wife needs him to be.

This was my first taste of the book series and I'd quite like to read the others at some point. I was a little worried that I wouldn't get into it, but from the beginning you feel like you're part of the sleuth clan and not just the reader.

This book series is based around Samantha or Sam to her friends that is a mystery novelist that turns the crimes she solves, with the help of her friends, into novels. It all started when she didn't get the information she wanted on how her husband died so solved it with the help of a PI named Clay. The Lush Life sees herself being dropped in it when Clay agrees to house sit for a wealthy couple in New Hope they'd both met previously but he couldn't do it due to a prior engagement and so left the house in her capable hands.

As the story continues Sam finds that more and more interesting characters are turning up at the house, some supposedly working for the Worths and others supposedly sent by Clay. But something isn't quite right and so we find ourselves trying to help solve the ever evolving mystery. We are continuously left guessing who could be the culprit.

It really is a fun humorous mystery unlike some that's out there with a mix of other things too like romance, it's perfect for anyone. It keeps the readers interest to the last page making it hard to put down. There is no way you can guess who did it until you reach the final page.",0.9972,71.68,1

also ARC of ""An Impossible Gift"" from Cristina Rayne,
as well as an ARC of ""Wish upon a star"" from Elsa Jade, in exchange for an honest review.

I'm loving this boxset so far, it has some authors I already follow & some new authors being introduced to me. Once I have read a book within, I'll add my reveiw for it.

The Clockwork Dragon by Tasha Black....
I FLOVE Tasha's ""Curse of the Alpha"" & ""Fate of the Alpha"" series & to learn that 'The Clockwork Dragon' is set at Tarker's Hollow.... made me do the happy dance. I was instantly sucked back into the lives of the citizens of Tarkers Hollow & I LOVED it!! Although it's centered around the Magical side of the community of Tarker's Hollow & not the wolves, you still get a scense of being there again. I was LOST in this, the story was rivetting.

An Impossible Gift by Cristina Rayne....
Oh My Goodness! That was short, fast paced & downright AWESOME! This is the first time I've read about Vamps from Cristina, usually it's shifters, but damn this story was good. Fast paced, full of action, loads of background story (you need this, believe me), a hot sexy Vamp who doesn't sparkle, all wrapped into a story about healing.

Wish upon a Star by Elsa Jade....
I am currently HOOKED on Elsa's ""Wolves of Angels Rest"" series, the minute one arrives on my kindle app, I'm devouring it quickly. 'Wish upon a Star' is a part of this series & what a Christmas story it was. It had me gripped from the very start, til the end... & just like the rest of the series, I devoured it & I wanted it to be longer.",0.9801,81.12,1
Kindle_Store_5,5,0,"Oh no the hell she didn't! I read the first book, Continental Divide, and was devastated by the ending. I wanted Jamie and Remington to get their happily ever after. I craved it. But, no. Laura Harner wouldn't let me have that. Instead she had them walk away from each other. Two years later we find that each of them is with someone new. I instantly hated the new partners because Remy was meant to be with Jamie. I pictured their demise in horrible, awful ways. My heart and head both hurt. I didn't want to like them. I refused. Then it happened. I actually fell in love with the new guys and couldn't see them being separated. Now I'm confused. This is book two of four. I have no idea where it will end, and believe me, I begged Ms. Harner to give me SOME clue, but she's remaining tight-lipped over the whole thing. So read this book, fall in love with some great characters, and delve into a mystery of sex, diamonds, and betrayal. I honestly didn't see this coming. My jaw dropped and I was screaming at my Nook (I do that on occasion, don't judge me!) Oh no the hell she didn't (again!). The author has said that this is going to be a four book series. I'm not sure how it's going to end, but I know that whatever path she takes, someone will be unhappy. I'm not sure who it will be, but I don't envy the author. She's remaining true to her characters and the vision she has laid out. I'm eager to see how it works out, even though I know it's going to cost me a piece of my heart when it's done.

Kindle_Store_5,5,0,"A great recipe book for anyone who wants to impress their family, friends, co-workers  (or themselves!) with delicious desserts. There's a lot to like about it. Here are my five reasons for giving it five stars:

1) An excellent introduction to the whole process of cooking caramel for those who are new to this delicious endeavor. Dennis Waller describes all the necessary equipment and provides helpful tips in his easy-to-read and easy-to-follow introduction.

2) All recipes follow the same format - and that's excellent because it helps those of us who have not done much with caramel before figure out what the main steps are in ALL caramel recipes. The same format makes these recipes easy to follow, thus, there's less likelihood of messing up.

3) I love the idea of adding some variety to the recipes, and Dennis Waller provides suggestions and options of what to change and how to change it. Love the idea of using spiced rum and Kahlua instead of vanilla! I'll just have to make sure I don't test-taste too much of either while cooking.

4) An excellent variety of recipes for different occasions, from more traditional to experimental.  Pumpkin Spice Caramel (and its Apple Spice version) and Spiced Pumpkin Fudge sound perfect for fall celebrations. Pecan Praline Caramel and Grandma Stella's Caramel would be great for the holiday season. The ones I'd like to try first are Spicy Chocolate Caramel made with Cayenne and Paprika peppers, Amaretto Almond Caramel, Bourbon Chocolate Pecan Caramel, and Chocolate Mint Fudge.

5) Pecan Pralines made with dried fruit deserve their own star!  Who wouldn't want to have dried mango, papaya, dates,  shredded coconut, or pineapple in their dessert. That will make it healthy, too. The five food groups, lots of fruit, and all that, right?",0.9967,71.75,1

For three agonizing months he's been drowning in fear and sorrow over his brother's plight yet having to put on his princely face and perform his princely duty. He's just about reached his breaking point when Savvy stumbles, lierally, into his life. She goes from saving him from a handsy title seeking woman and her daughter to saving his sanity. Savannah Breslin has ""been there, done a prince before"" routine and it broke her heart. She wants to protect her heart but being with His Royal Hotness breaks down her defenses. In turn Savvy becomes his anchor in the tumultuous storm of his brother's disappearance.  Duty keeps calling Kian away and his brother is finally rescued it seems he's pulled away from her more. Even though he's told her he loves her, she believes that they will never have a future because she is an American commoner. So she runs away to protect herself and deal with her breaking heart. Kian finds her and declares his love again backing it up with proposing. It seems this time she will get her prince and her happily ever after.

Tracy Wolff did a great job in combining two storylines: the hot and heavy romance of Kian and Savvy and Kian's journey through the kidnapping and rescue of Garrett. As Kian experiences the angst, anger, rage and impotence of not being able to find his twin, the reader experiences the poer of those feelings right along with him. The sizzle between Savvy and Kian is palpable and practically leaps of the page. I thoroughly enjoyed this romance and am looking forwarx to reading Garrett's story..",0.9901,69.52,1

Kindle_Store_5,5,0,"The best part about the 3rd installment of the IMA series is that it looks like it's not going to be a trilogy! The ending definitely sets things up for a continuation and that means more of my favorite fictional couple!

Locked and Loaded picks up exactly where Armed & Dangerous left off; right in the middle of Michael and Christina's first fully consensual moment of intimacy. It's nice to see the development in their relationship. Christina is still growing into her sexuality and sorting out her feelings for Michael. Michael is feeling somewhat vulnerable having confessed his love and now believing that Christina ""has him right where she wants him"" which makes him somewhat defensive. Or as Christina describes him ""Michael was like a half-tamed dog, as likely to turn on you as he was to snuggle up against you and lick your face, and just as slow to trust"". Their relationship isn't easy, but it is realistic and the characterization as usual is spot on. It is gratifying to see the emotion and trust grow between them; and Michael's sharing of his sexual fetish says as much about their individual growth as it is simply. rather titillating. The story is equally divided between relationship building and plot, suspense and intrigue. Christina finds that her plan of joining the BN to be trained as a hacker doesn't work out exactly as she had anticipated; and Michael still has the IMA and the psychotically evil Callaghan to contend with. The story ends on a Happily for now note. My only complaint is that it was too short. I want more excitement, more intrigue, more wonderfully enjoyable dialogue and more realistically portrayed emotional growth from my 2 all time favorite characters. (More hot sex and detailed fetish exploration would not be remiss either.",0.9946,59.53,1
Kindle_Store_5,4,0,"Ive decided to retire to Marietta and get a permanent ringside seat to all the excitement that seems to grace this little enchanting town. Bachelor auctions, hot cowboys, unsuspecting love weaving magic, and the essence of romance filling the air is just perfect, as these potpourri of authors create love stories around these wonderful people.

The second book in the Montana Born Brides brings out His Blushing Bride Piper Tierney even as Sebastian Bloom wants to fight his feelings for her. On a break from his doctorate program, Bastian comes to Marietta to attend his sisters wedding and ends up falling head over heals for the shy and blushing Piper.

Taking over from her father, Piper is the music teacher in Marietta High. Born with a birthmark on her face and having endured childhood teasing and bullying, Piper maybe a successful and beautiful, but her history with the opposite sex has a lot of learning to be done. And Sebastian charms her pants off and they fall into an affair that is supposed to be temporary or can Bastian convince Piper into becoming the next Marietta bride?

Dani Collins writes some really sweet love stories. I loved the fact that she gave her heroine a flaw that could happen to anyone. I admire the way she made Piper into this strong and independent woman, yet vulnerable and sensitive, wanting to be loved for who she is, a beauty inside out. And this beautiful lady sends Bastian into an emotional roller coaster as he tries to fathom his feeling for Piper and convince her of his love being genuine and permanent.

Another charming romance in the town of Marietta, and its always so very wonderful to revisit characters from the previous stories.

As a guest of the upcoming nuptials, Eve also has the uncomfortable pleasure of attending the pre-wedding dinner being held at the Bellefleur Country Club.  Here is where Eve is going to strike while the iron is still hot.  As she enters the country club, she latches onto the first unpaired male she can find and requests him as her date.  And she walks right into the web of Brent's cousin, Rainer Delacroix.  He makes her an offer she doesn't refuse and her seduction of the groom-to-be takes a different turn in the road.

Eve Met Her Match has a wickedly seductive kissing scene that leaves the reader breathless right along with the characters involved.  There are also some very swoon-worthy actions that make reading this short novella quite enjoyable.  The descriptions of each scene were adequate and well-written.  They don't bog down the story with useless details or babble.

At first, there is a bit of disdain for Eve.  I mean, she's only coming to the wedding to try and steal the groom away from a woman Eve used to call her friend.  Many of the secondary characters (guests that also attend the pre-wedding dinner) have no trouble seeing through Eve's charade.  It's perfectly clear what Eve's intentions are that evening.  Fortunately, she lands in the lap of Rainer, who does a sexy wicked job of seducing Eve and getting her to open her eyes and really take a look around.

This novella is sweet, sexy, and wickedly fun.

From page one Ms. Marcus kept me intrigued in this beautiful romance that was just fitting for two strong and independent characters. My favorite, though, just had to be Rory McRoy. He was just such a sweetheart of a guy! Theres nothing that he wouldnt do to protect and support his woman. And, Neve James has all that and more when it comes to her relationship with Rory. Yes, there were some pretty heavy misunderstandings between the two, but as they work them all out, just what exactly is their connection? What does a relationship with Rory really mean to Neve? And, is she in it for the long haul? In other words, can she trust him?

This starts off as a pen pal exchange of letters as Rory is overseas on military assignment. Their friendship develops into something more as the two correspond and then finally meet. But, when Rory is caught in what seems to be a lie while Neve jumps to the wrong conclusions, their relationship suffers until Rory helps Neve see the good in him and learns to trust him again. Ahhh, the romance, which is sweet and sensual. The drama, which is conflicting and emotional. The suspense, which brings truth and understanding when everything is now out in the open. Its a story that is tenderly touching when dealing with sad but yet truly genuine concerns. The dancer and the soldier  two people wanting to find that everlasting love that they can trust in. Whos to say that they didn't find it in each other? This one is worth taking a chance on!!! Ms. Marcus again writes romance at its finest...

It will take a stronger man to keep coming back to a girl for all intent and purposes beyond crazy. Blake sees something in Jordan and vows that he will get her for himself.
Of course I so fell in love with Blake. The way he handles Jordan is amazing, He doesn't let her run away. She gets so busy fighting her past shadows she misses the fact that she is falling for Blake. All the back peddling she continues to do, Blake just seems to stay close to her. Jordan strength is in that she has moved on from her pain to become who she is. Blake even his background doesnt define who he is. Giving Jordan the time she needs was prolly the biggest thing to help her over come her own demons.
The sex is soo shower worthy. (smiles) some had me even squirming. The first time they are together how he tells her to keep her eyes on him. He chased her shadows away. Opening her future and helping with her past, with patience and showing Jordon she isn't just a booty call.

Marco Alvarez is sent to Mexico with two goals  to watch Cams back and to investigate a series of arson fires.

This steady to fast paced plot keeps readers hovering on the edge of anticipation with suspense, action, drama and romance.

Tension building anticipation and curiosity draw the reader deeper into this world of magic and mayhem and the strong compelling characters are easily related and grab the readers attention from the very beginning.

The attraction between Cam and Marco radiates from every page and the sex scenes are hot and steamy, but its the relationship that has magic and sparks flying off the pages and the two argue and test each other with snarky and humorous dialogue as well as some fight scenes.

The author gives us a great chance to catch up with all of your favorite couples from the previous two stories;  Ari/Riely, Athena/Denali and Daynesha/Cesar.  What I really enjoyed and respected the most was the way these couples dealt with conflict when it arose, textbook for classy and mature adults.  This book is as much about this cast of friends as it is learning more about Arden and what she needed most in her life.  You simply cannot read this book and not wish you were part of this group's inner circle.

My favorite line in the book is delivered by my favorite man in this series, Cesar, he tells Athena ""You are the diamond Dee has been longing to treasure"".

This book is well written with its depth and characterization. The drama is not overdone (thank you) and the pace is perfect.  I feel as though I know this group of friends.  The men of this series are the type of men that every girl dreams of one day making their very own.  Well done.  I do have a question......Who is up next?",0.9962,70.73,1

The free sample was intriguing and it made me really curious as to what happened that separated this sexy biker from his little girl and her mom. Fighting to Stay is a book about a woman who always runs away from trouble or anything uncomfortable in her life and while I understand her reasoning, I don't agree with her immature thought processes.
Roam is that hot alpha male biker with a rough exterior but sweet softer side that he only shows to certain people. Lacey gets under his skin and their up and down relationship starts...and it blossoms into real love until some very devious plot twists and turns send her running away with his baby girl. I really liked this book even though it was a way more ""kindler, gentler"" version of a biker book than what I'm used to (more family and children around) and the sexual relationships were so steamy and heat inducing without being too sleazy (even a threesome!).
My biggest issue was the major skipping of time...chunks of elapsed time throughout the book was probably so the author could get farther faster and make this a complete standalone. BUT I also have an issue with books whose characters act without thinking things through and getting the ""WHOLE PICTURE"" before taking off. OMG...how many times did people not listen or not let someone finish a sentence before slamming the phone off and not finding out the truth before years pass!!
On the whole though, I enjoyed this book and would read more by this author as the story and characters were real and down to earth.

As American as apple pie! I have been getting into Sports romances here lately ever since I read Pucked By: Helena Hunting, while Rage does not have quite the comedic timing it is still an engrossing read. I love baseball, even grew up playing it myself with my friends so I have a soft spot for anything to do with the sport. AJ is the main character and while he's a bit of a hot head he's an awesome player both on the field and off if you catch my drift ;)

Until he hits the major leagues his temper has controlled his career but after a coach takes him under his wing and along the way he introduces  AJ to his granddaughter who is adorable! And leads to me changing my opinion of AJ, he's great with Clair and eventually meets her mother Addison. . . He makes a stellar first impression let me tell you! Acting like a Grade A . . . Well you know haha but he makes a huge turn around.

I really enjoyed this book, the characters were so well done and the author built up enough intrigue and tension between Addison and AJ that it made for a natural progression. Not like some where they meet and within the first couple of chapters they are falling into bed. I like that she was cautious of beginning a relationship because of Clair it made her a good momma which is one of my favorite character traits of hers. There are some twists and turns in this story that I didn't quite anticipate and that made me want to pick up everything Elizabeth writes from now on.

Book title: Alpha Wolfs Pet 2, Kept
Page length: 171
Price at time: $2.99
Review:  I was first introduced to Eva Gordons work through her first book in this series, Alpha Wolfs Pet book 1, hidden. I loved book 1 and have been waiting for book 2. I read book two in one day. The characters and setting are well developed. You can visually see where things are taking place and why. This story will grab you right away and you will not want to put it down.  The story doesnt leave you with a cliffhanger, but leaves you wanting more. I will be looking forward to book three. (Please read book one first)

Overview: Mia has just with through a huge ordeal. She was exposed to the secret society of werewolfs. She now has to agree to sign a non-disclosure and have the option of being his pet girlfriend (since wolves cant marry humans). Knowing that she is hiding from the mob and Dominic has offered to keep her safe and love her, she decides to sign the contract. But soon realizes that she will be subjected to obey all wolf laws, which includes being submissive to the alpha and being low man on the totem pole with the other wolfs, and with the werewolf King coming soon for his dead sons body, she struggles more. Mia is whisked away so the werewolf King will not order Dominic to execute her. When the werewolf King comes, he is not happy about what has happened with his son, with Dominic and his pet, nor is he happy that Dominic has a Pet instead of a Mate. Will Dominic be able to help Mia and save her from the Russian mob and deal with the werewolf King?

Kindle_Store_5,5,0,"I wasn't sure if I was going to like this or not - a mix of Tudor history and fantasy/magic? I was pleased to find that it was excellent, and I read it in two days!

The author clearly knows her subjects very well indeed, which always makes such a difference. The history itself is detailed and accurate, and I very much liked the accounts of the day to day domestic life of the period. I'm fascinated by the thought of possible alternative lives, and the idea of what might have happened had Henry VIII believed his wife Anne Boleyn over the accusations of her enemies is an intriguing one. Of course all events have a butterfly's wing effect, and Ms Taylor imagined the fates of other members of the Tudor court very cleverly. The politics of the day are very well described, too; how quickly, in those dangerous and turbulent times, one could fall from favour...

I am not usually one for magic/fantasy novels, but this element of the story was most convincing; it made me think of a more grown up and serious Hogwarts! I wonder how much of it was just the author's imagination and how much was taken from the beliefs and practices of the time; I imagine it's a combination of the two. I particularly liked the parts about numerology and the breaking of codes; oddly enough I was only watching a TV programme last night about the use of codes in secret communications during Elizabethan times, and Ms Taylor has all this spot on. To sum up, the fusing of history with fantasy is very successful, and I shall definitely be reading the next book in the series before too long. I think it would appeal to anyone interested in the Tudor period, and to those who enjoy reading believable fantasy.",0.9879,54.05,1

Kindle_Store_5,5,0,"Choose Yourself & Love You More by Author Lucie Jones

If there is a genre of book that I can identify with...it is an inspirational one!  The Introduction to ""Choose Yourself & Love You More"" is excellent as it quickly addresses the real issue and the difficulties we encounter in learning to love ourselves. It also stresses the need for internal positive self-talk. For many people, it is not so simple to look in the mirror and love what they see and who they are. As stated by Author Lucie Jones, it is very true that ""learning to love yourself is the greatest love of all"".  I'll even go one step further...if you don't love yourself you will never learn to truly love others. Charity really does begin at home. Therefore, I totally agree with her suggestion to have a better look at ourselves and learn to truly value who we are...

From the very first page right to the last, I can clearly see what this talented author's goals are and why she decided to pen this little gem of a self-help booklet. To love ourselves is not a crime...it is a necessity in order to positively change our self-image and move forward. Yes...we all have flaws as mentioned, however, they should not decrease our self-worth and affect how we live our lives. As this motivational author stresses, the benefits of self-love will enhance our opportunities to have better relationships. If we stop beating ourselves up...we will attract people who add to our positive dynamic which will result in healthier relationships. Who could ask for anything more? Great suggestions are given to help us follow a new direction and turn our lives around. It is an excellent place to start!

While Lola has disappeared, Beau is intent on finding her.  He goes through all the motions of being angry, looking for revenge and ultimately looking at himself and realising the part he played in this game.  How shallow of a man he became because of his money.  He realises that he loves her and not because she turned him down but because she is his equal and she owns his soul.  Lola has hidden under the radar while doing a road trip.  The trip opened her eyes up to discover what her future may hold.  After looking back on everything that they had endured, she knows she still wants him.  With her unexpected news and the realisation that LA is home, she heads home.  Can Beau convince Lola that he wants her without the games?  Can Lola ever forgive him?  I must admit I was a bit disappointed in this book.  The story lacked a building climax and was lacking conflict. Nothing much happened and most of what did made reference to things that we had read in the previous books.  In my opinion, I felt like the author was struggling to conclude this book.  The ending was really a bit of blas and the dialogue was awkward.  The head hopping between the characters was confusing.  I was hoping for more of a dramatic ending.  Overall the series was good but I did feel a bit let down by the ending..

This book is good, but one thing that threw me off was the passage of time; there was no indication of it. ""2 weeks later"" ""6 months later"" these are only 3 word phrases, it wouldn't take much to add them. But one minute it was Christmas, then after a separator in the middle of the page - which usually indicates a scene change - it's spring break, then next thing you know it's Thanksgiving. One of the reasons this is a problem is right before the page separator, Adam and JJ were saying they needed to discuss something important, and then after the separator, not only has it been discussed, but the process has been put in motion and they're almost completely done with it. No build-up or anything. This happened several times, which left me scratching my head and wondering ""well, what happened in between?"" I was glad that they were able to help provide a safe place for Thad, but what happened when they went to talk to his parents? Was there no argument or backlash at all? No obstacles in their way?

Or, at least they are until some unnamed, faceless person decides to play with Nikki and Damien again, by emailing them pictures of Damien in the throes of passion with someone else. But this nameless, faceless faction doesn't stop there. This person then moves on to sending Jamie, Nikki's best friend, a video of her in the throes with her former neighbor Douglas, who, unbeknownst to all his many conquests, films their sexual escapades on his laptop. Clearly, his video bank had been breeched, because, as it has been stated many times, Douglas wouldn't be able to hack his way out of a paper bag, even with directions.
But this huge annoyance (which isn't solved, btw, which leads me to believe that there will be more Damien and Nikki), is overshadowed by the true heart of the story. Valentines Day. Ms. Kenner certainly has a way with writing romance, and I can only hope that my first Valentines Day as a married woman with a man who owns pretty much the entire world is as romantic as Nikki's was with Damien.
Their celebration starts a few days early with a scavenger hunt, taking Nikki back to all of the places she and Damien have been to and loved in the past. The end result is a three day weekend at a private resort in the Bahamas, before coming back home to a few more surprises.
Despite having a few guesses as to who is behind this blackmail scheme, this was a very, very romantic book. Heavy on the between the sheets (or lounge chair) action.

He leaves with a torn shirt and red marks on his chest.  Courtesy of Black Betty of course.  His Fiance Heather is not too happy about this turn of events.  Engagement broken and Black Betty thrown into the headlines as the other woman.  The only thing wrong with that is Black Betty has been hiding from her ex.

Kiera is an emotionally stunted woman. She doesn't seem to know her worth & impresses her skewed view on those closest to her. Her best friend Kevin is admittedly in love with her, but demonstrates a lot of hate for her as well. It's as if his devotion has been one sided for so long it's become bitter. At the beginning, Kiera's relationship with Jimmy, a man she feels she belongs with, ends & her self-imposed spiral into depression takes a drastic turn when she has sex with Kevin. It's not hearts & flowers, you're the love of my life kind of sex. More like angry, you can get the hell out of my life kind of sex. This only proves to confuse an already confused Keira. This story centers around a woman trying to grab her bearings. Everything that she thought was real is being stripped away. She no longer has Jimmy, her man, or Kevin, her sounding board; her cupcake business is in ruins. Her life at the end of her twenties isn't turning out so great. Without giving too much away, this story has me on the fence. I liked it, and yet I found myself not really enjoying the heroine. Let me clarify; part of me liked her and understood her, and yet part of me wanted to slap her and tell her to man the heck up. She needed to open her eyes. I am having a love/hate relationship with this story. I suggest you read it for yourself. Oh and the ending...it was a tad abrupt, but seemed to suit Kevin, so I did like that.

""This Is Mine"" by Roy Glenn...

What I liked about this novel....

There is nothing I can say that can top saying this was anther well written captivating novel about Mike Black by this author. I simply loved the fact that Mike and Shy marriage is strong, Ms. Jada knows that Mike will not ever be hers so she can do what she does best and that is make money. Oh yes ....Wanda is back and Bobby is doing what he does best and that is being Bobby. I loved how this author was able to bring out all about Mike's father and family. Wow, how they were so alike in mores ways than one. Now, that will be interesting to see how this saga will turn out. The only thing left to say is that we the readers will be waiting waiting for the next great installment to the Mike Black Series.",0.9953,77.77,1

Kindle_Store_5,3,0,"I thought I would give this author and series a go with this book.  I have to say I was surprised that my attention was caught from the get go.

It was very interesting to see how Dominic spent the last 200 years buried at sea.  When he was 'resurrected' he was thrown into the future and struggled to catch up.  His friend Palo took him in and began teaching Dom how to survive in the new world he found himself in.

A few thing bugged me about this story.  The grammatical errors.  When Dom accused Palo as a 'trader'.  I think the word should have been 'traitor'.  So little things like that distracted me from the story a bit.

The author glossed over the transition period for Dom.  I felt that the book could have been much more detailed and the author could have had fun with Dom's struggle with the 21st century.  I realise the focus for Dom is revenge, but the writing could have been meatier and richer if the story went into a little more depth.

The sex described seemed to skip a few steps.  I won't go into detail in case there are under 18's reading, but there was no writing direction, the reader has to assume what happens and where the positions of the characters are.  There were instances where I had to re read passages to see if I missed some things.

In the synopsis Dominic is intrigued by a lady biker.  The only lady he showed an interest in was a mechanical bull rider at a bar he nearly got tossed out of!  So I wonder where and whom this lady is , cause I didn't meet her!

But it was a good start and I am definitely curious enough to get the second book!",0.9443,81.53,1

For years she had worked alongside her father to keep the ranch running smoothly and it has been her home and her life. She also discovers letters to her and her sisters from her late mother that bring news that change their worlds. While Callan fights to regain some amount of control over her life, Court lends his not only his supportive hands but also makes a proposal that could give Callan some resemblance of her old life.

I absolutely loved the characters, especially that of Callan and her sisters. They share such a cool bond and are really close and understanding. Callan emerges as this strong girl who is used to running a ranch and confident that she can continue to do so on her own after her fathers death. At the same time she has this feminine quality about her that is really attractive. Court on the other hand, at first at least, feels a little bit of an outsider. He is handsome and sexy and understanding. However, I really did not get their relationship. There wasn't much interaction between them, let alone courtship yet they end up in each others arm. For me it was like two strangers professing their love for each other.

The plot had some twists which were a welcome change from the usual romance novels. Courts background and Callans mothers letters provided some additional depth to the book. However, the letters written by Callans mother felt too clinical in nature and lacked the warmth of a mother. The letters read like appointment letters rather than a letter from a mother to her children, especially with the news it delivers, one would expect some emotional words.

C.J Carmichael is one of my favourite romance authors, but this book disappointed me a lot.",0.9959,70.63,1

I'm just reviewing this now, because I still remember things in the story; it's thread still excites me. I have it in my ""to read again pile,"" which says a lot.

We all have our gender discoveries to make, many take a lifetime to resolve. Far be it from me to judge from afar without walking in someone else's shoes. I buy books that I like for content. I don't care if it's a ghostwriter, a straight man writing as a lesbian, a f2m, m2f, transgender. Or any other gender I missed. Reviews should be about books, and author's style; they should not be direct attacks on said author's person. And full disclosure: I was born a woman; and, yes, I am a lesbian.

I went into it kind of blind, wondering what it was about as i loved the cover and title and just wanted to read it.

What a charming wonderful guy Caine was...romantic, caring, singing to her in front of everyone, melted my heart...a perfect gentlemen, opening car doors, a little possessive, but that is because he loves her right?

....he has an alcoholic mom and a troubled past and when events in life take a surprising twist....she agrees to marry him, even after a hiccup in their relationship...after visiting the courthouse, he stops opening the car door! Where did the gentleman go? My Heart Sank.

That was it..after reading along happily i was suddenly stopped dead......wow! You think you have been got with
what is coming next....no, you haven't!!

I loved the relationship between Lacey and Becca, i was laughing out loud during their conversations and in the hospital during the quiz i was freaking screaming! (You will know when you read it)

From 'The Pussy Doctor'....to 'Aunt Flo visiting', to the Smurf scene, i could barely breathe and this was such light relief after i had been through the drainer living through Lacey's life.

I hate to think what Lacey would have done without her friends and family.

I wanted Becca's con's list carved into his back with a rusty knife.......i think Becca would have done it.

The ending was something else, one thing.....then another, all wrapped up teetering over the edge of a sharp dark cliff edge!

But what we do have is a very well-written and engaging story about a young man's experiences as he becomes an intern at a large well-to-do church. In the hands of most writers I would have probably been bored to tears but Mr. Moody creates a fun and entertaining look into the quirks and idiosyncrasies of your standard Baptist style evangelical church. As one who has spent many years in ministry I can say he hit the nail on the head. No matter where you are or what you are doing people are a trip.

If you're the type that likes easy going stories with no stress or books that won't keep you up too late at night I suggest getting yourself a copy.

If you're concerned about the book being preachy because of the topic you have nothing to fear. There is very little Biblical reference at all. It's more about the people and the inner workings of ministry in general. You'll laugh and be entertained. Even non-believers will enjoy this book. It was a nice stressless experience for me and I enjoyed it much more then expected. It'll make a nice seashore read for a lazy vacation.

Kindle_Store_5,4,0,"While Finding Libbie starts in the present day, it soon moves make to the 1960's, to that time of the Vietnam war, when women mostly still stayed at home and didn't go to work. When some were bored and fell prey to drugs and alcohol.

Libbie comes from one of the most wealthy families in the town. Her family or at least her mother places her value on wealth to measure worth. Her sister was someone I really disliked, she was a real stirrer of the pot. Libbie's dad was good, if somewhat indulgent and with the penchant to look for a life of turning a blind eye to what was going on in his home.

Jack was a hard working young man, in love with Libbie but as their life progressed he could see all was not right with Libbie. (They married so young - as  many did in those days.) So when Jack's daughter discovers that he was married before the marriage to her own mother she is very curious as to what happened to Libbie. As the reader I was too, what did she do in the intervening years? How did this fragile, anxious but sweet young woman fare?

It is Emily - Jack's daughter who when she learns of Libbie in her father's life spends time searching for her.  It is a time for her too to re-evaluate how her own life is panning out and whether  the man she is with, is right for her.

The story comes eventually to a heartwarming and moving conclusion. I was amused at how well all the threads of the story were detailed out in the epilogue. It is rare that that happens!

The story examines mental illness and the lack of understanding in the past that led to much suffering. It is a story of second chances and growing into a place of contentment and self fulfilment.",0.9387,78.99,1
Kindle_Store_5,4,0,"I definitely had a love, hate relationship with this  book. When I began to read  the book I wasn't very impressed at all. I couldn't really figure out who was who and what the story was really about. So I decided that I needed to continue on in order  to give a fair review. I'm so glad I did. The author has written a very intricate mystery that  kept me guessing throughout the book. The action is explosive and at times very intense.

Jake is a former Marine who has  a keen sense of awareness of his surroundings. I thought his  character was good and had lots of depth. He is smart, decisive, alert and had great instincts. He has a new job as a photojournalist. While following someone he inadvertently stumbles upon an assassin  at large. The assassin does  not like lawyers .  Jake seems to get one step ahead and then takes two steps back in this lively story. Who is the assassin? Why are lawyers being targeted?

I thought the assassin  was a brilliant character because he was so unpredictable. He reminds me of a ticking time bomb. You never know when it will go off but you know when it does , chaos follows. I liked the multidimensional, quirky and very unnerving characteristics he had. What I really like was how the assassin even controlled the people who hired him. With cutting words he was in control and calculated his every move. He does some very ingenious things to divert the attention away from him and on to Jake. Will Jake be able to prove who the assassin is? I recommend this book to mystery lovers who like intrigue and characters that jump off the pages with intensity.

He loved her with all his heart and protected her to the point she could do nothing a normal teenager and young adult should have experienced at her age, he was frightened of anyone getting to her and using her as a bargaining chip or worse against his life and to take his control and power.
After having to move in with Kate her sister/cousin she met Kiran and wow, their chemistry was obvious straight away. Kieran  has a heart of gold but was guarded from events in his past and did his best to keep his distance from Belle but they both just couldn't stay away from each other no matter how hard they tried to hate each other.

Kindle_Store_5,3,0,"It was a case of All or Nothing for me. The crux of story sold me even though there were parts I did not like. An aptly named series, Wicked Games play out in this book for Jena. Unwittingly playing a game she has no idea she is a participant in, it appears that by the end of the game she could lose everything. Character and story issues left me with mixed emotions. I liked King, but I did not like his original game plan and I had a hard time reconciling the man who went into the game with eyes wide open to the probable repercussions of what he put in play with the man who fought for his woman at the end. We also got just enough info on King and Wick to know they are not good guys, but not enough to know what exactly it is they do. At times, their actions did not match their words and this disturbed me greatly. Jena came across as dumb as a box of rocks, dismissing what was happening around her by resorting to excuses and sticking her head in the sand. She evoked frustration and sympathy simultaneously, but it was her weakness that lost me in the end. Timeline issues unsettled me as well, as in when did King and Wick meet? Was it in when they were kids or in the military? It cant be both in my head, yet both were stated as facts. A proper back story on those two would have improved this book immensely, probably cleared that issue up and added some character depth that was missing. A little more about Jenas old job would have been nice too. And after all that you're wondering why I said I liked it? It was all about the game for me and on that level it delivered to the point of me wanting Wicks story next. Spices Rating: 3.",-0.9543,78.59,1

Kindle_Store_5,3,0,"Anyone familiar with the Desire, Oklahoma series will recognize the cast of characters in this story -- including Dillon and Ryder. The newest addition to the town comes in the form of Alison (Ally as affectionately referred to by Ryder). Alison comes to Desire on the heels of a bad breakup from an abusive boyfriend. Similar to all the other stories in the series, Dillon and Ryder come swooping into her life completing ensconcing themselves in it while overwhelming her with their (neanderthalithic) overbearing ways and masculinity.

The story prattled along at a lumbering pace, IMHO, as Alison whined about things being ""none of your (Dillion and Ryder's) business"" (said 14 times) and spanking threats from the men (mentioned 33 times...yes...I counted). The story was highly repetitive...not only of itself but of the other stories in the series. Really the characters in these stories are interchangeable because the story lines are so consistent with one other. This series now has 8 books in it...and honestly, as a reader, I'm getting to the point where I don't care because there is nothing unique about them anymore. Desire for Three: Winning Back Jesse is actually about the characters in Desire for Three. *Scratches my head*....so now we're going back and revisiting characters? Pass!

Don't get me wrong, I enjoy Leah Brooke's work, I just want to see some originality come into play in her stories. As they are now...they are just meh because of near exactness of the stories and characters -- resistant females...dominant men...and they all live happily ever after. I'd like to see her throw some different characters in a the mix. Send someone of a different nationality to Desire to find love. Send a couple looking to add to their triad.......give me something different to work with.

Raw Desire wasn't unenjoyable...I just though it could have been much better and different.

Trey is hurting because the girl he wanted belonged to someone else. He throws all his attention into his work. His younger brother Jett is back and is working with him. He and Trey go to a bar and Trey ends up drinking (which he doesnt do) and spends an amazing night with a stranger.

That company sends a person to represent them and come to find out, its the girl Trey had that night with, Faith. From there sparks fly and the back and forth between them as they are trying to win the account is so good! They have a love/hate relationship but the attraction is there. talk about hot!

I have read some truly remarkable horrible stories based on facts over my time but this one is truly dark, full of mental and physical anguish, abuse and RAW emotions its tangible. You can feel it oozing out from its pages. I am taking deep breathes here. Its somewhat written as a memoir, but in other parts reads like a novel. Except for the fact this was reality for the author. There are advisory notes from the author:
If you yourself are disturbed by abuse and any of the violent abusive events in this story, she says, do not read unless you can survive it or it can lead YOU down a dark path:

If you have been abused, the same applies

Its interesting to me that she has not written this for a therapy as most do or a story to be told. The mental state and dark places this author went to in writing this book is deeper than a very deep black hole. She says how the book has not been edited and re edited so as to take the meaning and exact happenings out of this true story. It is how it is. The woman that is broken and quite frankly mentally disturbed [and who wouldn't be by this] is different from the woman today. This is not written as a memoir it is written more like a novel. Do not think you can read this book for enjoyment, definitely not. Its a journey, its a learning curve, its a lesson. Anyone can take something away from this read. There is no way I can say its NOT distressing because it IS. The author admits, she was insane when she wrote this, as an advocate for mental awareness, I would say, she definitely was emotionally distressed, disturbed and needed mental health care to cope.

I must back up and say that this is the first book by Erin Noelle I have read. Not bought. Read. Ive had a few of her books on my Kindle for a while and I have a few in paperback. I really could kick myself for not reading her books sooner. I mean really. I was totally missing out. I just went and one clicked two more.

The Perfect Life was perfect to me. A book that took over my life for the time I was reading it. I finished it in one day which is a rarity for me. I couldn't put it down. I was consumed by it and the characters.

Its the perfect story with the perfect characters and perfect writing. Its unique and creative and has something added to the plot I never would have thought of.  I literally felt this book in my chest. And no, Im not exaggerating. My heart raced, I felt anxious and I felt the intensity between 2 Oliver and Monroe. Their attraction and chemistry is unbelievable.

The characters are so lovable. They are broken and imperfect yet perfect. I want Oliver in my life. His quirkiness is beyond adorable. Hes fun and sweet and romantic and charming and I adore him.

The Perfect Life brings up some serious topics. Life isn't perfect. For anyone. What appears on the outside isn't always how things are behind closed doors. It also tackles some other real life issues which I won't get into as not to spoil it. But it does so with grace and tact. And mixed in with the heaviness are moments of tenderness and love, and wit and humor that will have you smiling and laughing.

I loved it. All of it. The Perfect Life is perfect!! You won't regret one clicking. I promise.",0.9976,87.62,1

I have a thing for time travel books. It started when I was a kid with A Wrinkle in Time and has continued throughout my adult life. I've read Outlander multiple times and practically hug it at night. I just find time travel love stories to unbearably romantic.

""Paradox Lost"" was a nicely done time travel story with some good romantic chemistry. I always enjoy Libby Drew's writing. She writes in a way that feels... easy. Her stories have a great flow to them and this one was no exception. I was hooked from the start and effortlessly got into the groove of the book.

I had a few problems with some of the finer details of the story. Reegan had a PhD in history and was supposed to know the time period of 2020 like the back of his hand. That is why it was irritating for me when he didn't know some pretty basic facts about the era that he was visiting. He kept trying to open things voice activation and bumbling through 21st century appliances. It felt odd to me that a time traveling historian wouldn't know when things were invented.

Also, I kept thinking that Reegan's speech would sound different from Saul's. If I think back over 100 years and I traveled to that era, I would stick out from the moment I opened my mouth. I kept waiting for them to comment on accent or speech usage or something like that.

I tend to think of all of these details when I read a time travel book and they become distracting for me when I find inconsistencies.

Despite my nit-picking, this book really did have a lot to offer. It had a decent amount of action, some nice sex scenes, and it kept my Kindle glued to my hand all day. A solid 3.5 star (aka between ""liked"" and ""really liked"") for me.

Kindle_Store_5,5,0,"This is the perfect story to read when you have a few hours free and you just want to dream away and relax for a little while. Stranded with the Scottish Earl is a sweet romance novella that has a handsome, Scottish lord and a stubborn English woman in it. It swept me away from the beginning and I really enjoyed it.

Miss Charlotte Warren is living the perfect life or at least she believes it is and she thought her father thought so too so shes a little surprised and hurt when she gets a letter from him telling her that he has found the perfect husband for her. In no way will she agree to marry this stranger!

Ewan Macrae, the Earl of Lyle is looking for a bride but he never thought that he would find her in a little village in the countryside but her father (who he met in London) made him curious enough to make Ewan decide to pay her a visit. But he never thought that a spring flood would leave them secluded from the outside world. Something that works in his favor because the woman that he meets isn't very welcoming. But he knows in his heart that shes the woman for him. So now he has a few days to convince Charlotte that marrying him wouldnt be a bad idea. That hes worth it and he will prove it in any way that he can.

I really loved the banter between Charlotte and Ewan and yes, everything did go fast but thats much in the case in novellas. And sometimes you just want that magic where one look makes someone fall in love. Where love is simple. No fear, no hesitation just the knowledge that that one person is the one for you.

Kindle_Store_5,5,0,"I loved Desiree Holt's book, Joy Ride.  As a matter of fact, I can honestly say that Joy Ride turned me into a Rock Band Romance Junky.  With that in mind, I'm here to tell you that Aftershock, the sequel to Joy Ride, has more than satisfied my appetite for this sub-genre of romance.

Aftershock is a truly amazing read.  In my opinion this story is even better than Joy Ride.  You do get to catch up on what's happening with the hero and heroine of Joy Ride, Marc and Emma, as well as getting to know the other members of the band Lightnin' a bit better.  But you also get to meet Sydney Alexander, newly named promotions agent for the happening, new-on-the-scene band Lightnin' who is hot, sexy yet somewhat troubled by some past life experiences and the nasty, bitter aunt who raised her after the death of her parents.  You get to learn more about Rick Trajean, leader of the band, Lightnin' while savoring all the sweet, sexy details of how Syd and Rick fall for each other.  Then hold on to your hats because things get a little wild when the nasty villain enters the picture.  Let me tell you.  Desiree Holt writes THE BEST villains and she sure doesn't disappoint in this story.  You are going to love hating this villain.

Desiree Holt is one of my absolute favorite authors.  I love her writing style.  Her characters are always so real.  The story line is always sure, succinct and sure to grab your attention.  All this is true in Aftershock but she goes beyond the usual.  I felt like I was really backstage listening to Lightnin' perform during the concert and interacting with everyone after the concert while reading this book.

Kindle_Store_5,4,0,"The Wedding Trap hit a bunch of sweet spots for me. It had a little suspense, a little steam, a heroine that was likable and it had humor. I love when a story makes me chuckle. There's nothing too slap-stick about the humor; it's mostly dry observations that the heroine makes about the absurdity of the situation in which she finds herself.

When attendees of Isobel's wedding aren't swallowing that Alex is Beth's boyfriend ""Charlie"", the rumors start swirling, much to Beth's mortification, that ""Charlie"" is really a gigolo she has hired to save face. Since Beth can't tell the truth about Alex being a CIA agent on a case, she has to roll with it.

EXCERPT:  ""Alex grinned. ""They all think I'm a prostitute, don't they?""

""Yep,"" she said. For some reason, Alex finding humor in the situation only darkened her mood further. It wasn't funny-it was disastrous. Spencer had gotten exactly what he wanted: she was a joke.

Given what had happened to her today, it shouldn't have mattered. But for some reason, it cut deep. She imagined what the epitaph on her gravestone would read.

Beth Bradley.

Liar. Sinner. John. ""

There were maybe some unrealistic moments in the plot as far as the CIA procedures go, but I don't know how they roll, so I don't really care. And this story takes place over the course of about 3 days or so and that's a short time to fall in love. But, again, I'm not reading romance for the realism. I would have liked an epilogue to find out how they settled into coupledom (I'm making up my own words, here). But there are two more books in the series and hopefully Beth and Alex will be mentioned so we can know how they fare.

This book is written in the 3rd person with both heroine and hero perspectives, it's unequal--there's more heroine than hero. I'd rate the steam at PG-13. There's a few scenes, but they aren't very explicit.",0.9857,82.14,1

Kindle_Store_5,5,0,"For many years now, I've been a fan of the true crime genre; reading nothing but these nonfiction tales of the worst side of mankind. After a while, while still interested in the crimes, the forensics, and the inner workings of the justice system, a reader can easily reach a point where the crime in and of itself has no shock value.

That was not the case in my most recently read book: Pure Murder by Corey Mitchell.

In Pure Murder, Mitchell tells the gut-wrenching, absolutely sickening tale surrounding the deaths of two Houston, Texas teenager girls: Jennifer Ertman and Elizabeth Pena.

On what should have been a short walk home through on of Houston's city parks, these young girls had the bad fortune of meeting up with six of Texas' teenage lowlifes: Efrain Perez, Raul Villarreal, Peter Cantu, Joe Medellin, Venancio ""Yuni"" Medellin, Jr., and Sean O'Brien.

Simply because the young, innocent girls were in the wrong place at the wrong time when these scumbags were ""feeling their oats,"" they were tortured, raped, and murdered.

For the first time in a while, this true crime piece managed to enrage me as I could not hardly fantom that in a group of six people there was not one decent individual that could have, in some way, helped these young victims.

And, as an added bonus, especially in a time where illegal immigration is such a hot topic, the attempts by Joe Medellin to use his illegal immigrant status as a means to absolve the indictment against him was, to say the least, infuriating. He participates in the raping, mutilating and murder of two young girls and he expects that this country will allow him freedom on a technicality?! I could not even begin to understand the audacity of this pathetic, spineless child killer.

The quick of it...Okay so Jackson is a sports analyst and Leila...the new sideline sports reporter who's working under him. And oh the attraction and intrigue they have for each other! For the first time they've found someone who thinks like they do. It's numbers and stats and seeing how puzzles fit. One thing that won't fit? An office romance. *le sigh* And so a yummy battle of wills begins...

First up...Jackson. He's so yummy it's hard not to think naughty filthy things in his direction. Leila certainly had that trouble. And, well, he does too so double the fun for us! lol The connection between the two was great. I loved that they both have a thing for numbers and stats and think the same way.

Jackson's just flat out delicious. He's hot, sexy, at the top of his game, is a world class flirt and he's a good guy (sometimes he's a little too perfect) but he cares about people. I really loved the heroine too! She's a football junkie, a good person, hard worker and funny! I totally fell for her and her humor.

Their romance was slooooooow moving since they didn't want to risk her job at the network and whatnot but I loved that they became friends first and totally respected each other. But oh when it heated up! Oh, yeah! It seriously heated up. There were sweet and aw-worthy moments between them too that totally had me in a swoon. Oh, and he's got some growly alpha male in him too so it's not ALL sugary sweet...

Of course there was a little bit of relationship drama. I didn't totally buy into the reasoning behind it--it was a little shaky to me--but overall I was still on board.

Mac is a security expert, ex-military, who needs a fiancee quickly as cover in his negotiations for an arms deal that is about to go down. Kelli is his sister's best friend, someone he vaguely remembers as a cute pig-tailed girl, but who will do in a pinch. Imagine his surprise when this vivacious gorgeous woman (who unbeknownst to him has had a crush on him for years) shows up for duty. The question is whether Mac will let the temporary arrangement they have turn into something more. I loved this story! Kelli is such a fun character - feisty, flirty, full of life. She has loved Mac from afar for so long, and now has the perfect opportunity to seduce him into bed and hopefully ingrain herself a little bit into his heart. Mac is also wonderfully written as a strong, handsome confident man, stoic on the outside but holding in strong passions on the inside. He feels that it's his duty to protect those around him and getting involved with a woman is too distracting. But Kelli is such a delicious distraction that he is willing to let down his guard just a little - long enough for her to get into his bed, and maybe a little corner of his heart as well. The sexual attraction between them sizzles and the love scenes are steamy and well written. Along with the relationship plot however is some suspense and action as well as Mac's job takes them into dangerous territory. In addition moments of humour abound, making the reader laugh out loud many times at the crazy antics that ensue.

Since I am from Kansas, I usually read books with Kansas as the location since most authors do not find Kansas interesting enough to write about.  This is an incredibly good book.  I loved this.  It starts in St. Paul shortly after the Civil War with Seth, an army officer, and Jem, a spoiled daddy's girl.  Daddy calls all the shots in this marriage, including how to raise Charley, Jem and Seth's son.  He bought their house, gives Jem an allowance, hires their help, everything.  When her father gets caught with his hands in the Army's cookie jar, Seth and Jem must sell the house and move.  Seth decides they are going to Kansas.  He actually winds up in Nebraska because the house is across the state line.  They move and start a new life.  One that Seth thinks he will control and start to call the shots.  God has other plans.

Jem is a wonderful fictional character.  She is soooo dramatic and funny.  She cracks me up even when she is being horrible.  Against her will, she toughens up and matures into a valuable woman.  Her character alone is reason enough to hope for this book to be a series. The end will stun you.  The only thing I did not like was the format.  I hadn't read carefully enough to see that the format was for an i-pad.  I have a kindle.

Kindle_Store_5,5,0,"I don't know why I chose this book as the first book of Cole McCade to read but I am so glad that I did. This book is not for the faint of heart. It has strong elements of abuse and was very dark at times but still beautifully written. Poetic, lyrical, yet dark and gritty, raw and full of emotion. Leigh is an amazing young woman. She is strong yet broken, fragile and dangerously damaged. There were times that it was hard to read because she felt that she deserved what had been done to her. So as you hear in so many instances of abuse she continued to be abused (we read in great detail much of the abuse) and yet we see her grow stronger as the book continues until she finally decides that she will no longer be the victim and to finally fight for what she knows she deserves. The beautiful Gabriel is also broken but he is broken because of his choices to not feel the pain that was inflicted upon him by war. Gabriel sees the brokenness in Leigh and yet from the first time he meets he, he is drawn to her. There were just so many elements of this story that kept me reading it and not the least of which is Cole's ability to draw you into an emotional level with each character in the story, feel their pain (I have since learned that he does this because he has experienced it) and finally experience the freedom of love. Even with the rawness and grittiness, Cole turned this story into one of beauty. It is also evident that Cole is a great lover of books because there are ALOT of references to books, both subtly and not but he weaves them into the story beautifully. Even his acknowledgements were touching. Cole is definitely an author I will be following and reading and could there possibly be another story in the Crow City, fingers crossed!!",0.9915,74.22,1

I was so frustrated because it ended as a cliffhanger ..and if I have never said it enough times ..Smiling)...I truly DISLIKE cliffhangers... Having said that Ms Devereaux was kind enough to send me book 2 for a free read and review as I did the first book ..Book 2 ......IS AWESOME,Exciting,Raptourous(sp?) ... OH I could go on and on ...  but seriously book 2 really gets into the ""nitty gritty"" of the storyline ..guess you could say the bones of who Sophie and Marc really are .... and what transpires between them and the other characters of their lives...Her writing is beautifully and wonderfully done... Sophie and Marc's characters are so developed in this book that you understand them far better ..The plot holds you from page one ..just as in book 1 you have the suspense , mystery and a glimpse into some BDSM ...even tho the sex scenes were more detailed in my opinion they were still not Explicit sexual content.....but they were good :)
I only have a slight sign of negativity and it starts around chptr 12 / 13 and goes on for a few chptrs ..you kinda get aggravated at the wishy washy ways between the 2 characters and makes ya want to reach in the book and slap Sophie into Submission  yourself..but.
 Ms Devereaux  comes back with a kicker..
Even tho Sophie and Marc's story is still unfinished ..... book 3 & 4 of this series jumps into a completely  new set  of characters.from what I have been led to believe in reading the reviews of them I myself have not read them ...
For me this book ranks 5 stars and book 1 would have been 5 stars but I was frustrated at the ending cliffhanger ... this one wasn't quite so bad ...but alas you still have a cliffhanger at the end...

Kindle_Store_5,5,0,"This book is basically a continuous of book one. It pretty much picks up where book one ended. The only difference is there is more of Bran And Tyrone's point of view through out this book along with Lance and Tide.

In this book I was able to see that Lance and Tide where able to feel more comfortable in their relationship. I feel that theirs is more of a relationship and less based around the BDSM lifestyle. I feel like they practice parts of the BDSM lifestyle but they r definitely not 24/7. I feel like each day that passes Lance was more comfortable in his own skin and that Tide is really good for Lance because Lance feels like he has the freedom to be himself and enjoy his desires because Tide supports him in his choices. They really are a great couple in my opinion.

Tyrone and Bran have been together for a long time in what I would definitely say is a 24/7 Dom/Sub lifestyle. They know each other's wants and needs but I feel like they have gotten complacent in their relationship and do not realize they are not meeting each other's emotional needs any longer but instead only the physical needs. Don't get me wrong they are still a very much strong couple in my opinion but I feel like maybe they are too comfortable with each other and I believe that Brans tumor scare is exactly what they needed even though I wish I could have happened in a better way.

Bran and Tyrone have to reevaluate their relationship and make changes and I believe this is a very good thing we're their relationship is concerned and I have no doubt that hey will continue to be a very strong, loving couple in future books in this series.

He is a very rich man who is looking for someone different from who is usually spent his time with. He goes to his long time friend Victoria who runs an escort service. Victoria sends Saga (Meadow) to Jackson knowing she is just what Jackson wanted except for a few overlooked details. Saga tells her self after meeting Jackson that she will not fall for the attraction she feels for Jackson. He is just a job. Jackson pushes his attraction for Saga away by telling his self that she is just a warm body to enjoy when he feels the need to. You are going to want to bash these two heads in at times. At times you're going to love Jackson how caring he is but then he turns and says or does something that you just want to slap him for.

Sean could burn water, but his ex lover Isaiah is a world class chef, so he calls in a favor. Isaiah Waterston has never gotten over the betrayal he felt when Sean left him to pursue his career ten years ago. So when Sean asks him to pretend to be his lover for the weekend and cook a meal for the bosses, Isaiah is hesitant. He makes an assanine comment about topping Sean in exchange for his help, and immediately regrets it when Sean agrees.

Dinner is a huge success as is dessert which consist of Sean laid out naked on the dining room table for Isaiah&iexcl;s tasty treat. The two spend a whirlwind, sex filled weekend together and Sean is more than eager to make his pasts mistakes right. But Isaiah is not buying it and leaves while Sean sleeps and to add salt to the wound, he doesn&iexcl;t return his texts or calls. Can Sean convince Isaiah that he still loves him, he&iexcl;s changed and he&iexcl;d give up everything he&iexcl;s worked ten years to build for another chance with him? Or was one last hoorah all Isaiah was in this for?

I have a new found fascination with interracial M/M novels and novellas, and Dessert did not disappoint!

The story centers around the present situation with Sean trying to get his lover back, attempting to make up for past mistakes. But there&iexcl;s enough of the past and their individual current lives sprinkled in to add a little depth to the story.

Gideon Shaw is the sexiest man in Hollywood,  every man wants to be him and every woman wants to do him.  He has a very successful career with endless opportunities but the only things that mean the world to him are his family and his best friend and personal assistant Paige Turner.  He has loved her for as long as he's known her but he can't cross that line.  He can't risk losing her friendship if anything goes wrong.  And let's face it, he's an actor in Hollywood, plenty can and will go wrong.

Paige Turner is a Cornell University graduate that could do anything she desires in the business world.  When she came to L.A., the last thing she would have imagined doing was working as a PA for an actor.  But this actor wasn't just anyone.  In fact, Paige had almost single handedly invented this persona and without her, Gideon Shaw would not be the box office phenomena he is today without her.  She loves him but she can't let him know.  She values her friendship too much to even think about allowing him to learn her true feelings about him.

And then fate stepped in and threw them both for a loop.  They had to decide if the disasters that can only happen in Hollywood would destroy them or if they would come together and find a way to turn their friendship into something so much more than either of them was willing to admit could be possible.

Suzanne Halliday's story takes you through the challenges of a young couple that share love for one another but do not know how to tell each other how they feel without losing what they have and each other.  You will see how sex, drugs and the debauchery of Hollywood can affect a blooming relationship.

The good:

-The characters are great. They are charming and funny and I love that they focus so much on  family obligation

-The authors paint a wonderful picture of small town life

-There is a mixture of humor and more serious things going on within the story.

The not so good:

-There are a lot of spelling and grammar mistakes. A lot of mixed up he/she. There were also times that words were used in an unrealistic way. I don't think any woman has ever thought that she would like to feel a mans cock against her integument, though that is just my opinion.

-There was tons of unnecessary details given. I don't need to know that he turned the shower on, then checked the temp, then got in, then picked out a shampoo, then picked out a body wash and on and on it goes. The story could have been cut in half without losing anything of importance.

-pov jumped around a lot which is usually good but there was no real flow to it.

-There was just too much going on. The focus should have been primarily on Quinn and Mhisery with Chance getting his own book. The little glimpses of other people seemed out of place as well.

-It often felt like rather than reading a story things were being ""explained"" and there was too much repetition and even some inconsistency. He goes down on her at one point and then later is surprised that she is pierced there?

All of these distractions led to me not being able to enjoy the story even though I really wanted to, especially as this book was given to me in exchange for an honest review. I would really like to try another book by these authors though because there were things I really enjoyed.",0.9527,77.16,1
Kindle_Store_5,5,0,"I have had to honor of receiving this book from the author for an honest review.  With Every Heartbeat was such a sweet story. I immediately fell in love with Annalise and Raphael!
  Annalise ate, sleep, and breathed to dance. Ballet is her life, every since her mother put her in her first pair of ballet slippers, she could not focus on anything else. Her mom had been a dancer, and she was following in her footsteps.
  Going to Rome with the American Ballet Company was an honor. Fighting for prime solo spots, training hard, and focusing on nothing else. Until she walked away from the group on afternoon that is.... Stumbling across a group of street dancers may have changed her life for good.
  One look at Raphael and she knew she was in trouble. There was something about the way he danced, so free, so alive... and those eyes!! Although she knew it was wrong, that she was risking everything, she continued to sneak away to meet him, just to melt in those eyes, in those strong arms.
  Agreeing to dance with Raphael she had to train her body to move differently. Years and years of ballet dancing could not have prepared her to be able to dance with a partner like him. She is falling in love, and she can't stop herself.
  After finding Raphael dancing with his old partner, Annalise is undeniably heartbroken. Not giving him a chance to explain, she runs. Beats herself over and over for being so naive and stupidly denying the training she needs for her once in a lifetime performance.
  The story of Annalise and Raphael is heart gripping. I loved reading how their story played out and how their love for music was engrained in every step they took in life. The book did remind me a lot of a movie I've seen... American girl meets hot young Italian, who sweeps her off her feet! How can you go wrong!? SWOON!

Kindle_Store_5,5,0,"The Glimpsing is an intriguing and haunting tale of revenge, love, hope, faith, courage, and the age-old battle of good vs. evil.

The author creates a very Twilight Zone atmosphere from the beginning of the book, with nods to Alfred Hitchcock, Rod Serling and Stephen King. Although I wouldn't classify it as a horror story, it incorporates the psychological horror and suspense for which the above three are recognized as masters.

Portia Childress, brought up by a mother who has the ability to ""glimpse"", see into the world just beyond our world, wants the one thing she can't find in her relationships with men: true love. How she deals with this unfulfilled need is the center of this tale.
The mysterious painting reminds me of aspects of ""The Picture of Dorian Gray"" and subsequent stories involving mysterious, ""changing"" paintings but this has its own unique flavor.

It is easy to identify with Portia's innocence and need but more difficult to understand where she went as result of it. Gabrielle, in spite of her own love for Jack, tries to remain loyal to Portia and to love her best friend. Jack's increasing feelings for Gabrielle only complicate the situation, bringing about some of the ensuing horrors.

My favorite character in this story, though a minor one was Jack's housekeeper, Janice. She has the wisdom to get an idea of what is going on after Jack first receives the mysterious painting, offers Gabrielle a way of dealing with her own guilt and ultimately is willing to risk dealing with something she is worried is beyond her ability to handle, because of her belief in doing the right thing.

This was a refreshing read, standing out among the current ""horror"" stories that I have read with its unique presentation of that battle between good and evil. Well worth the time invested in reading the book. Unfortunately because it would give away spoilers, I can't go into the details of the unique perspective presented in this story, but I think any fan of the horror/supernatural realm would enjoy the book",0.9846,54.86,1

At times this book brought me to my knees because I could feel the pain of Liam and Quinn. These two have been dealt a s*** hand. The book does flip from past to present a little more than my liking but you do need the back history for their story to make sense.

Quinn is a kid that has a mother who doesn't want her, she throws her out at 15. She has to learn how to survive on the streets. Being a 15 year old young lady on the streets is dangerous. And living in the wrong part of town you only have a few options in survival, drugs to numb the pain or selling yourself to devil to have some money. She makes her choice and it is neither. She meets Liam and he is living the same life. No parents, the abuse can be to much when you go from foster home to foster home. Liam learns to fight to survive. And when he meets Quinn he fights enough for both of them. That is so much for anyone to handle but they both do they best they can with what they have. Now go forward 10 years, their demons are still with them. They carry them everyday but Quinn did what anyone at young age would do when her world crashes, she ran as far away as possible leaving Liam behind. Liam did what he did and does best he fights. MMA fighting. But what brings Quinn home brings them face to face again. The question is, is it to little to late or will they save each other once and for all?

Kindle_Store_5,3,0,"I didn't have very high expectations for this book. The combination of teen romance and historical fiction made me nervous that I would be cringing the whole way through. Fortunately, the author did her research and the result is a fairly accurate portrayal of life in a convent in Renaissance Italy, with a splash of magical realism. The romance elements don't really kick in until the halfway mark, leaving most of the book to focus on other aspects of the protagonist's life, what romance there is isn't overbearing or unrealistic. A plot twist 3/4 through helps keep things fresh with an unexpected change of setting for the final act. The book is largely well-written, but there are some poor descriptive techniques scattered about (""as cold as January"" was a particularly bland simile that stuck in my mind).

Where the book disappoints is in the drama. Most elements of the plot had me wondering why these characters care even half as much as they apparently do. The protagonist is a 17-year-old illegitimate daughter of a recently-deceased nobleman who's been sent by her step-mother to live in a convent. This is problematic for our hero because the only thing she wants on this world is to find a man to marry. A more charitable reviewer would say that she's realistically very focused given the options for those in her situation, but her one-track-mind struck me as obsessive and overly dramatic. The aforementioned plot twist is fairly transparent (if you're expecting a twist), and the while the MacGuffin around which the twist is centered may be historically accurate in terms of its importance, it seemed fairly trivial to me and fed into the overall feeling of unnecessary drama.

The protagonist's personal conflicts are sure to resonate with many readers, particularly girls around her age and younger. Readers who have an interest in art, particularly painting, might understand the drama better, and will definitely appreciate the author's descriptions of the art and architecture. The ending could be interpreted as slightly preachy, but it doesn't detract from the book.",0.9786,48.23,1

Kindle_Store_5,5,0,"This is definitely my kind of book. It has everything that makes a really good thriller/adventure/military read. I loved the added mythology angle that was backed up by real sites. The science angle was believable and a the human experimentation added to the spine tingling parts. The action starts with the first page and you hardly have time to breath between pages. Robinson takes the reader on a rocket ride of adventure, treachery, treason and death. Each of his characters has special talents. Melding them into a fighting team is King's (Jack) job. In this story you get a lot of background about each team member. How and why the ""Chess Team"" was formed. Why Jack chose each name. Where Stan got his Desert Eagles. The first time Jack and Zelda met and what happened. How he won her respect and the rest of the teams. The bonds they formed with each other to become the fighting unit they are. Their first mission is to rescue a scientist who can translate an ancient manuscript. She has been kidnapped by unknown persons. The Chess Team follows the bad guys from Afghanistan to Iran and finally to France. They fight the Chinese tong, mutated humans, and unspeakable horrors. Finally in France they face the end of all life and maybe, the end of the planet. This is my first book by Robinson but not my last. I have already got his other Chess Team books on my ""to get"" list. I wish they were all audio books narrated by Jeffery Kafer. He has a very pleasing voice and gives life to the characters. He gets the dialogue between the team just perfect. Sometimes too perfect. LOL. The production of the audio was perfect. No static, dead spots, or skips. Everything was professional and well recorded. If you have read any of Jeremy Robinson Chess Team books you HAVE to read this one. The start of it all. Audiobook provided for review by the narrator.

Kindle_Store_5,5,0,"This standalone conclusion to the Norseton Wolves series is one of my favorites. Holley Trent has a gift of getting inside her character's heads and succinctly communicating their emotions, fears, hopes and desires to the reader. I don't know of any other author who can lay a character open with such understanding and yet do it with humor and compassion.  She is one of my top five authors, in part for that reason. I highly recommend this book and the series, which can standalone individually, as well as from it's companion Afotama Legacy series.

Arnold has only been in Norseton a few days when he has a vision that takes him to the Roosevelt Forest in Colorado. He has seen a she wolf and her baby and all he knows about them is that the goddess wants him there to meet them. When he arrives, he sees the woman shift into her wolf form, leaving the infant unprotected.
Leonora was recently bitten by her mate and is forced to shift with the full moon, requiring her to leave Kinzey alone in the forest. She's on the run from a culture that denigrates women and an abusive relationship where she is seen as a possession rather than a person. She made her decision to run and having no support system is a consequence of that choice. But she has very strong protective instincts for her daughter and when she returns to her human form to find a strange alpha male wolf shifter cuddling an unusually calm Kinzey, she's enraged. He refuses to hand Kinzey over, though, and she soon finds they are headed to Arizona, to a pack he says is different. How can she believe him, when what he says goes against everything she's ever experienced?  Especially when he bites her while they are in wolf form and neither of them remember anything from that run. He promised her she would have choices at Norseton. But  the first thing he did was to take them away.

Erin is good at tennis, but while she likes it, it doesn't mean everything to her, not the way it does to her mom. Erin's mom is determined that Erin use her talent for tennis, and become something really good, but Erin just wants to have a normal life.

One day whilst visiting her grandmother, Erin finds herself sent back in time to 1970, where she has the chance to play tennis against her mother.
Who will win the match? Is Erin better than her mother? And how will Erin get back to her own time?

This was an okay read, but it felt a little awkward in places.

Erin liked tennis, but not as much as her mother did, and more than anything she wanted to be a normal teenager, and go to the movies with her friends when she wanted to. Erin tried to fit in when she realised that she had travelled back in time, but I expected her to be a lot more concerned with how she was getting back than she was. I personally would have been worried about how I was going to get back, and how soon I would be able to get back rather than making friends in 1970 and taking advantage of how cheap the prices were in the shops!

The storyline was okay, but the time-travel aspect felt a little strange. At the beginning of the story we hear from Erin how annoyed she gets with her mum, and how irritating some boy at school is, and then we're suddenly thrown back in time to 1970. Very sudden, and unexpected, and just didn't fit well with the rest of the story.
The ending was okay, and it was good that Erin learned a little about the sort of person her mom really was. I also liked the fact that Erin's actions in 1970 had consequences, and that her meddling in the past changed things in the present.

Overall; an okay time-travel/coming-of-age story.

The setting is Honk King. Andra, a young woman who now lives here gets the shock of her life when she finds her neighbor across the hall dead. Did they mean to get Andra?

Arriving on the seen is Max, a linguist who is trying to solve a puzzle that has landed in his lap in the form of a doll with the message, Find my heart. Find my girl. Why is he set to locate Andra? He needs her to crack the code of the message and the reason why it was set to him.

This starts off the pair in finding a mythical village that is run by and populated strictly by women. They need to learn a lost language to solve this mystery. Toss in men who are after you at ever turn, the plight of our characters just intensifies.

I do have one part of the book that left me flat. This is not a big book. I get the fact that Max and Andra who start off as friends start to like each other to where they get romantic. While I am not someone who likes reading romance in a book, if it is done in the right amount I am okay with this. The amount of scenes where we saw these characters expressing their feelings for each other and their interludes to me was too much and less would have been just as effective and the point would have been made just as well. I wanted to get on to the mystery and not turn a page and yet again see them being lovey toward each other.

This was a quick read, and you could easily read it in a short time. I loved the story line of the village, language and how it was all tied into a doll that was delivered to Max. That really was fun to read. Overall, this is a good read and for the price you truly cant go wrong.",0.98,88.97,1

Toys_and_Games_5,5,0,I am a mom of a 3 year old and I grew up playing this game and I want to teach him how to play this fun game. It arrived before delivery date so I was excited to get it early!,0.8846,84.51,1
Toys_and_Games_5,5,0,"just like in Disney world but much cheaper, and trust me the whole family was entertained when I used the toy and pretended to make it talk (great way to spend the hours waiting in line for rides) fun fun times",0.962,63.7,1
Toys_and_Games_5,5,0,"It's like the Zombiestrike Sword, only shorter.  But hey, it's a miniature Katana (kuh-tuh-naw).  How cool is that?  Is it worth the dollar increase over the Zombiestrike sword?  Probably not, but to some, having variation is everything.",0.8541,80.88,1
Toys_and_Games_5,5,0,"These are great, but understand they're toy soldiers for fantasy nerds.  As long as you don't expect more than you would from their green and tan counterparts, you will be pleased.  Actually, the quality is quite a bit higher.",0.7506,75.2,1
Toys_and_Games_5,4,0,"My only complaint about this set is that is constantly falls apart at the hinge.  Even though I have to reassemble it regularly, my 4-year-old loves it and has spent quite a bit of time playing with it since Christmas.",0.5106,76.56,1

Toys_and_Games_5,1,0,"This toy would benefit greatly from an on/off switch.  My 9 mo old seems mildly entertained by it, but you can't turn it off, you can't put it away. I think I'm going to have to get rid of it.",0.431,91.82,1
Toys_and_Games_5,4,0,"For the price, this is a good deal. It's a very small box. Probably the size of a mini puzzle box. Definitely not worth the 16.00 it's listed for right now. I paid $8.00 for it and that's a decent price.",0.6038,99.33,1

Toys_and_Games_5,3,0,"Super cute dolls however the arms/hands come off rather easy.  They are supposed to, as in Monster High School doll style, but these are way too easy to pull off.  We lost an arm within an hour of play.",0.8555,92.12,1
Toys_and_Games_5,4,0,"I wish the music played continually instead of turning off after one song as my son hasn't mastered hitting the button for another song. Regardless, its a good distraction in the car for him and the two volume settings are nice",0.802,59.13,1
