Electronics_5,5,CG,The MCX adaptor is just what I needed.  The included adapter works great for the first couple of months and then the phone
Electronics_5,4,CG,Fun to play with but not an easy task. I will say that it's been pretty stable since I got it.
Electronics_5,4,OR,Nice sound.  For the price range it's a great option. Use it by the pool.  Does seem to take a bit of time to sync.
Electronics_5,5,OR,It works fine and was a great replacement when I frayed the cord of the original charger. I bought three of them to put in various classrooms.
Electronics_5,5,OR,"My laptop does not have card reader and I need something like this one. I bought one, which was falling in pieces. This one is virtually indestructible."

Electronics_5,5,CG,"I only use SanDisk cards, not the SDHC cards I need.

The only downside is that the card is a bit pricey"
Electronics_5,5,CG,"Now you can mount 2 speakers on top of each other.

Electronics_5,5,OR,This is the Mercedes of home networking routers. Fills my house with a strong signal. the 5GHz band is perfect with my Nvidia SHIELD. Great management interface.
Electronics_5,5,OR,"This little book light is great for the price, the light is broad and spreads across both pages and the clip is secure enough not to fall off."
Electronics_5,4,OR,Great drive. Clean and basic. Not super fast but not super slow. It does crap out and have smart errors if you plug it in and out enough.
Electronics_5,5,OR,great headphones. sounds good and loud as I like it. a must buy!!! the headphones comes with three different size rubbers and a case for storage very nice.
Electronics_5,1,OR,This item did not work when plugged into my car slot. Tried both my cars and did not work. Wouldn't suggest anyone to waste their time on this.
Electronics_5,3,OR,"Mostly ok, but I never found a connector tip that fit snugly in my Compaq laptop.

In the end I used electrical tape to hold the tip in place."
Electronics_5,5,OR,"These are probably the best bluetooth headphones around.  Light, attractive, work extremely well, easy to pair......what more can I say...I love these.  Bought a second pair."

Electronics_5,5,OR,It is a good hub & can turn on/off 3 ports at a time if don't need to use especially I have many printers & external hard drives.
Electronics_5,3,OR,"Apparently such a simple setup is very hard to do. Easy to install, but the audio quality left something to be greatly desired. Static, buzzing, and over-amplified volume."
Electronics_5,3,OR,"Sticks well, but over time about a year it showed ripples where I slide it in the iLuv case. I need to learn how to get it replaced."
Electronics_5,5,OR,"I bought it for carrying our camera during our hiking trip. It has multiple pockets to store camera, batteries, and memory card. I was very happy with it."

Electronics_5,1,OR,From a review I read I expected a lot more; then I looked at the price and realized I got just what I paid for: inferior product at best.
Electronics_5,4,OR,It doesn't seem to receive as well as a ground plane antenna but the SWRs are fine and it has held up in a few very nasty wind storms.

Electronics_5,1,OR,It's unfortunate from micro USB connector failed after about 35 days of continuous use. If you can't charge it you can't use it. This is a basic design fault.
Electronics_5,5,OR,i love this case it has a nice black finish and all components fit comfortably inside with room to spare. It also has ample room for cooling and extras.

Electronics_5,5,OR,I'm very happy with this 4tb drive - I'm using a two year old iMac with Snow Leopard as my Operating System and haven't experienced any glitches or problems.
Electronics_5,5,OR,A must when using multiple cameras. I run two GoPro's on my motorcycle and I can run for weeks at a time with only 4 batteries and this charger.
Electronics_5,5,OR,"Worked perfectly first time with my iMac. Drive only got about 35MB/sec transfer rate, but that's about what you'd expect for USB 2. For under $10, I can't complain."

Highly Recommended if you are looking for the convenience of wifi.....beats buying a new camera!"

Electronics_5,4,OR,I was just pleased to be able to find them at all let alone at a reasonable price. now i'm set for a while although i probably should buy some more.
Electronics_5,1,OR,A waste of money. Has come apart after only a few months. Wasted money. I will go for a real tripod now. Angry that Amazon doesn't stand behind the products sold.

Electronics_5,5,CG,Nice filter - good price. I love the look. The filter is a little fuzzy and doesn't fit snugly around the edges.

Electronics_5,3,OR,"Fits good, looks good, scratched my new LCD screen, even though I am very careful when covering the TV.  The inside front material should have some padding or a soft layer."

Electronics_5,5,OR,Great cheap pair of headphones.  Sweat doesn't seem to bother them.  They seem indestructible.  Sound is good.  Super-light.  You can barely feel them.  Great for jogging.
Electronics_5,5,OR,"the screen is super amazing
i used it on a surface pro 4 and the screen split makes more productive and the quality of colors is even more than the surface screen itself"
Electronics_5,4,OR,"Really great quality, our 2 toddlers haven't been able to break it yet.  I wish it had a kick-stand (ordered one previously and sent it back since it kept tipping over)."

The slightest wind will knock it off the table, and break the feet if they're clamped."

Electronics_5,5,OR,"No-nonsense SATA interface. Plug-and-play. It doesn't work on full-sized, 3.5"" spinners, but that is to be expected. 3.5"" spinners usually require additional power. For SSDs and older laptop drives, this is wonderful!"

Electronics_5,4,OR,Brush works well but I wish it had a cap to keep dirt out of it when in storage. Smudge tip works pretty well too. Looks cheap but feels well made.
Electronics_5,4,OR,This  device is a bargain at the price. It is great for travel or home use. A negative is that the user manual is poorly translated into English from (I assume) Chinese.
Electronics_5,3,OR,Connections are light duty and can break as mine did. It should come with a power supply as the connector is metric and was a little difficult to find a mate that fit.
Electronics_5,5,OR,"Great little speaker!  Connects right to USB port, not bulky!  Nice to have while just lounging in bed or on couch and need a little more sound!  Excellent sound quality!!"
Electronics_5,5,OR,This is the best option i've found for wiring a speaker-level output from a receiver to an RCA style input on an amp. The female to female connectors will come in handy too.
Electronics_5,4,OR,its a compact bag. if you want carry more things. its better you bought bigger one. its tight fit bag. if you want to buy bag for only camera its a good one.
Electronics_5,1,OR,"I couldn't stream content off of the device to anything. I gave up shortly after I got it and sent it back. Not worth the money, the app and device just 'aren't' there."
Electronics_5,4,OR,Overall its working great - I just have to turn it off and back on sometimes so that it plays audio from a WDTV live player. But at this price its a bargain.

Electronics_5,5,OR,"Holy Moses, what's not to like about this lens? OK, sure... it's 1.8 and not 1.4, but seriously! For the price what do you expect? This lens should be in EVERY starter bag."
Electronics_5,5,OR,"Bigbox store wanted 4 times as much for a shorter cable,
use it daily plug/ unplug, roll it up throw it in my laptop case, don't treat it very well and it still works!"
Electronics_5,5,OR,"I added these two batteries, which came at an unbelievable low price to the one that came with my Pansonic Lumix camera and now I can shoot for days and days without recharging."

Electronics_5,5,OR,This is a great receiver.  I wish it had bluetooth and the ability to stream from an android phone but I knew this going in.  Yamaha seems to make a solid product.
Electronics_5,1,OR,"This cable arrived DOA. It doesn't appear damaged in any way, but it definitely doesn't work. I tested it on four different computers and two different monitors, and the monitors never got a signal."
Electronics_5,5,OR,I had bought a monitor and it never did 4K with the display cord I had. I then bought these and now 4K works on that monitor. Will keep buying these for our office.
Electronics_5,4,OR,"Ordered these for my wife but they were too large for her to wear while trying to sleep.  I returned them and go an instant, no hassle refund. They lookednice, just too large."
Electronics_5,4,OR,very nice. it works well for a 6 inch nexus 6 and a 10 inch asus tablet.  it is very elegant.  admittedly the price is quite high for a price of metal.
Electronics_5,5,OR,light enough for everyday school backpack. core i3 fast enough for everyday normal use. it is perfect for all student. Unless you are developing large application or hard gamer. This one is just right.
Electronics_5,5,OR,If they can keep this quality up for a few years ... before being bought up by a company that will drive the quality into the ground for profit. That would be wonderful !!
Electronics_5,5,OR,"If you have a Promaster XC tripod, you're probably purchasing this because you need a replacement or you'd like a second for convenience.  I fall into the latter, and this has worked great."
Electronics_5,5,OR,"Just what I needed, and the price was just right.  I bought it used, with a few scratches and dings, but who cares because it works perfectly for my iPad and Samsung tablet."
Electronics_5,5,OR,only found on amazon for me. only amazon provides you with quality hdmi cables at fractions of the cost. its impressive and you don't always need those lengthly ones to get the job done.
Electronics_5,5,OR,Works really well.  My wrist and fore arm where getting achy with my normal mouse. This really helped.  Takes a little while to get used to the upright grip but worth it.
Electronics_5,5,OR,This piece does not come with the ring light. This holds my camera in the center of the ring light and allows for easy adjusting. This is a must have for ring light photographers.

Electronics_5,5,OR,I have used literally thousands of discs of various brands and I have found these PHILLIPS discs to be extremely reliable. I've recorded a dozen different file formats and could not be more satisfied.

Electronics_5,5,OR,Great! I can actually hear the individual instruments on what I am listening to. I love getting really hammered on the weekends and watching Youtube and these Etymotic earphones make my buzz more enjoyable
Electronics_5,5,OR,Great sound. Much louder than I expected. The Bluetooth signal never drops off and battery life is at least a couple of days worth of workouts. I haven't run the battery completely dead though

Electronics_5,5,CG,I am getting to where I need it.  I've got a lot of things to do.  I am using it for a portable desktop and have a laptop in it
Electronics_5,1,CG,Nothing happens or can happen.  The only way to fix it is to just throw the one in a bag.  The plastic part is also very stiff and not flexible.
Electronics_5,5,CG,I JUST THOUGHT I WOULDN'T BE A LITTLE GENTLE PYTHONER.I had a lot of trouble with the TV
Electronics_5,5,OR,"A Person (s) asked me to by these (3) for her- them. One was very pleased!  WV is hilly , so no signal could be picked up . But it is a good product."

Electronics_5,4,OR,Very nice replacements to my iPod ear buds.  Sound quality is at least as good and the cord is longer.  Alos the angled minijack helps keep the ear phones from becoming unpluged easily.
Electronics_5,4,OR,"The sound is amazing but I can't really make them stay inside my ear, and I've tried all included sizes of the rubber. If you move the cable it ""rubs"" and you can hear it."
Electronics_5,5,OR,"What can I say it works as needed, usually last around 3 hours of full use on a battery only.  For the price you can't beat the battery.  It fit perfectly as well."
Electronics_5,1,OR,Never could get this thing to work right. I hook it up to all the right connections; but get no response on the monitor. It has been added to my dust bin of useless parts.

Electronics_5,5,OR,"At this price point, these stands are sturdy, spring loaded, beefy, strong and have a decent case.  They are not small but are considerably lighter than other brands.  They are definitely a bargain!"
Electronics_5,5,OR,As long as they don't lose any files from my weddings I love them. I have never lost files from a wedding so I worry when I purchase new CF cards. So far so good.
Electronics_5,5,OR,"Nice, simple, basic, small.  Purchased as a gift, so I can't speak from experience, but I did open it up and look at it.  Was a good fit for a small Nikon Coolpix."

Electronics_5,5,OR,"I am really impressed with the sound quality of these headphones. They are very comfortable and I love the fact that they fold up. I wish the plug was angled,but this is a minor issue."
Electronics_5,4,OR,"It's a good little clock, it is not too bright. You get what you pay for, however it will not pick up an FM station 20 miles away but it is a good alarm clock."
Electronics_5,5,OR,"Can't give a true feed back for this as got it for my son, but he loves loves it updated for an older version he had a long time and it never let him down"
Electronics_5,5,OR,"Worked fantastically. Good heavy paper makes an easy seamless background. Good color as well. It is heavy and it does want to unroll, but I read the comments here and was prepared with a clamp."

Electronics_5,5,OR,Works great ! just be careful of putting to much cleaner on your dash but even with that you have to take corner pretty fast to get this to slide. I would def buy again
Electronics_5,5,CG,For $17 it was a bargain. The quality is good but it's not a perfect fit. The bottom is too tight and the plastic feels cheap and the plastic feels cheap.

Electronics_5,1,CG,"I wanted to like this stylus, but it just wasn't as good as I expected. It is so small that it's not portable and takes up a lot of space."
Electronics_5,3,CG,"Ok this is a toss up. The quality is ok but it's not really the best one.

I had a friend who said that the sound was ""good"" and"

Thank you, I will definitely buy more from your store!!

Electronics_5,2,OR,I've only had it for 6 months. Half the screen doesn't even show up anymore and now it's not vibrating for notifications or when I've met my goal. Serious suckage. Will not purchase this brand again.
Electronics_5,5,OR,I couldn't be happier with this purchase. Everything was just as described. The PC came loaded with a genuine copy Windows 10 and a 90-day warranty. The system is fast and responsive. Perfect for my needs.
Electronics_5,5,OR,"Great purchase
Bought this one because the office pull boxes were painful.
This bag is nicely constructed, nice compartments, and even distribution of weight. The wheels roll smoothly. It's not high society style, but perfect for my needs."

Electronics_5,1,OR,Just got this. It is not universal for ski poles. It does not fit on the slim carbon composite  ski poles. They don't tell you that. It also broke.
Electronics_5,1,OR,This router drops the signal on a consistent basis.  Too bad it started happening after my 30 days and I can't return it.  Plus one of the antenna's fell off during the initial installation

Electronics_5,5,OR,Son loves the thing carries it around with him. Loud lots of bass has it paired to iPhone and Samsung tablet. Uses it to charge his phone on car trips. Very good quality and excellent sound
Electronics_5,5,OR,This is a great price for a filter.  It appears to be glass and protects well.  Hasn't scratched so far.  I would recommend it instead of the very high prices some stores charge.
Electronics_5,4,OR,"I'm not sure where the review went that I already left for this product a few days ago. He's a brief re-post. Nice mount, easy install. Needs adjustment for tightening part that mounts directly to monitor."
Electronics_5,5,OR,"This is the remote that should have come with the TV, like the keyboard for doing searches on YouTube.  Would recommend this remote to Vizio ""smart TV"" owner who didn't get one with their TV."
Electronics_5,4,OR,I have been using this drive for my mac book pro with the hard drive tray for about 6 months and it has worked flawless. The increase of the speed of the computer was very notorious.
Electronics_5,4,OR,I needed a way to hook up my external sata dock to one of my computers and it killed me using 2.0 USB port over eSata. This dropped right into my system and solved my problem.
Electronics_5,5,OR,For this price it solid. you get tons of the bells and whistles you can not get with this care for the price range. It stays very cool and it very solid case.
Electronics_5,5,OR,This battery allows me to shoot all day without worrying about how much juice I have left. This kind of peace of mind is priceless. A professional battery for professional photographers that gets the job done.
Electronics_5,5,OR,"These are *great*. Replaced an ancient set of 10"" Fischer speakers that had been with me since college (they were circuit breaker protected, fortunately!). These are primarily used for theater fronts, and they have great sound."

Electronics_5,4,OR,"It works nicely. To customize it is a pain. Double press this button, hold that one for 16 seconds, yadda yadda...with with some time and patience you'll get it to where you want as far as sound."
Electronics_5,4,OR,"Pros:
Super adorable
Sturdy

Cons:
It's a little on the heavy side
the chain could have been a little longer.

Final Thoughts:
This was an adorable gift for those owl lovers. It was such a surprise when you find out that it's a USB"
Electronics_5,5,OR,I just needed something portable to take away the harshness of my external speedlite for when I cannot take my other equipment with me. I love the velcro strap and that it can fold flat for storage.
Electronics_5,5,OR,I bought these way too lengthy but since they are excellent cables i don't mind. Will find a use for the 80ft i have left (haha). Get these with some banana plugs and you're good to go.
Electronics_5,5,OR,If you want loud clear clean sound these speakers will shred your hearing. They are amazing and don't cost a lot. They look great in my car and blow my head off. Very happy great job Rockford!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Electronics_5,5,OR,Ummmmm . . . this actually didn't work with my Mac.  Didn't work with Yosemite.  Gave it away to someone who had Windows.  Maybe they fixed the problem but I don't have it anymore.
Electronics_5,5,OR,Like this trackman & for the price it is great once you get use to it it will become an old friend at first I was not sure I liked it but now I like it allot
Electronics_5,5,OR,"Perfect!!! Just what we needed for our camper, the old burned out. If we had taken it to the RV place they quoted us $230.00 PLUS Labor to install it...  This price felt like a steal~~~"
Electronics_5,5,OR,This is the fastest charger I've ever used. It literally charges from low battery to 100% in less than an hour. But it does need an outlet plug. It's much slower when a USB port is used
Electronics_5,5,OR,"Best keyboard cover I've had to date. Laptop keys still have a little bit of ""give"", which I like, and the material just feels nice on the fingertips. Will buy more once I'll wear this one out."
Electronics_5,4,OR,I purchased this set as a last minute purchase- the product is good. It chages quickly and is lighter than the Nikon brand I had been using. The car charger is great. Good product for the price.
Electronics_5,5,OR,"Great price. Very fast. Had it for over a year now with no issue.
Durable little thing.
I have owned this for years now and it is always taking punishment on my key-chain and still going strong. Very durable."
Electronics_5,5,OR,I'm thinking C.DelSol just didn't switch displays on his laptop. By default laptops only have a video signal to the built-in screen.  There usually is a FN key combination to turn on the external video port.
Electronics_5,5,OR,Well worth the $$ ....My Garmin wasn't holding a charge anymore. Figured I'd give this battery a shot. I really think this battery holds a charge longer than my original. Love it. Easy to install yourself too!
Electronics_5,5,OR,"These work nicely, but the actual ""holder"" for the
cannon battery is a ""sled"" that likes to fall off the charger..  I lost one sled, bought a second charger.  The second unit I taped that down."
Electronics_5,1,OR,Disregard any review where the cable wasn't cut to make a run.  Every reviewer who cut the cable has pointed out that it is not Cat6.  There aren't any copper wires. This cable is junk.
Electronics_5,5,OR,I love this camera and all of it's many features.  Don't buy the kit lens. It is not worth the extra money.  I put a C. Zeiss 24-70mm lens on it and it is wonderful.
Electronics_5,4,OR,Can't beat the price.  We were building a new home and wanted these buried in the wall so we needed a lot of them and at this price it did not kill us to do it.
Electronics_5,3,OR,"Very imprecisely. You have to try very hard to make it work on the screen. Well, I guess the tablet was not designed to be written on anyway so the pen is an OK product to me."
Electronics_5,5,CG,"Works great, installed newest Kodi (iPod) and it works great. Nice little speaker! Works great. Great price!Works great. The sound is great."

Cons: The plastic parts are too small to fit comfortably in a case"

Electronics_5,5,OR,"Love it. In my retirement days I use it daily with my W10 Dell Venue 8 Pro for emails, browsing and Youtubes. It sure beats using the on-screen keyboard. For ""heavy duty"" full-size applications I use my laptop."
Electronics_5,5,OR,Bought this as a gift upon the recommendation of someone else.  The recipient really likes it.  It had to be easy for him to use because he is 86.  He really seems to like it.
Electronics_5,5,OR,"How much do I love Samsung SSDs? Too much, probably. Great price for when you want that insane improvement in all things speed. Use this as a boot drive and put all your data on a 7200RPM HDD."
Electronics_5,5,OR,I ordered this RAM to upgrade what my Mac Mini had in it.  Popped it in and it worked like a champ.  Hats off to Amazon and Crucial for a quality product at an affordable price!
Electronics_5,5,OR,"Love this cable! My data throughput has definitely increased, and the cable being flat allows it to run beneath my large area rug undetected. Add the normal fast Prime delivery = this was a great purchase."
Electronics_5,5,OR,"This case should work well to protect my iPad from getting bounced around on the boat (I know it's not waterproof--the iPad sits on dash at a great angle.  It is a bit heavy, but fit well."

Electronics_5,4,OR,I bought this lcd last Christmas to be used in my bedroom. I have no complaints. The picture and sound are fine for late night viewing. The sleep timer is very convenient. I consider this a great value...
Electronics_5,5,OR,"I actually got these to use just as a pocket magnifying glass. I'm sure they're decent when attached to a camera, but they are great for viewing tiny stuff and for getting campfires started without wasting resources."
Electronics_5,5,OR,"Bought refurbished from 6ave. Item is practically brand new, and very clean, also came with the Nikon leaflet. This is a nice versatile lens for carry around, everyday shooting. Here is my first nightscape with this little gem."

If you want a performance boost from any of your Hard Drives that have eSata, this is what you have been looking for"
Electronics_5,5,OR,Cable works fine-hubby thought it was crap until he discovered the little plastic caps on the end. Once he got it hooked up to the TV and soundbar he stopped calling it crap and started calling it awesome.
Electronics_5,5,OR,Just as good as the battery that comes with the GoPro but cheaper and you get two. I have not tried to charge the official battery in the charger but the Wasabi batteries charge in the GoPro fine.

Electronics_5,5,OR,"This is a wonderful flash for my Olympus OMD5 - small and powerful, just like the camera... and the ability to tilt the flash as well as regulate it's intensity makes it a real asset to any photographer."
Electronics_5,5,OR,this hub was exactly what I needed to hook up additional usb devices and the size of it made it more desirable. I'm happy with the device and the transaction as well. Thank you from one satisfied customer.
Electronics_5,3,OR,"Works well, Two issues.  It is impossible to focus on higher magnifications without having the object being looked at up inside the opaque plastic cone.  Also the light is not dimmable and is sometimes too bright."
Electronics_5,5,CG,I use it in the garage and it does the job well.  I have a large collection of other external hard drives and I am using it in the garage to store a lot of data.

Electronics_5,5,OR,"Inexpensive,and works great. Very securely packed to prevent shipping damage.
The instructions and data were spot on, including voltages at startup and at idle. It has multiple stage charging, going to an idle state when the battery is fully charged."
Electronics_5,5,OR,"Great keyboard. This is the perfect keyboard for when you have your computer hooked up to your TV for watching movies.

WARNING: It is fairly small, I wouldn't recommend this keyboard for heavy long-term use, keys are small as well."
Electronics_5,1,OR,"Really like it; then it started to sound crackly at times like a loose connection. The sound would disappear, but I'd fiddle with the connection and it would come back.
Now it's gone -- no light, no sound.

Not very durable."

Electronics_5,5,OR,"it fits my tab 10.1, my boyfriend's tab 7.0, my iphone, his galaxy sl, fits anything you want to stand. It is adjustable, and adjustments are small hence you can make small adjustment to fit your viewing angle perfectly."
Electronics_5,5,OR,This is a slim case designed for all models of the iPad mini. The mini snaps into the pressure fit back and has magnetic three-section lid that turns the iPad of and on automatically. Good case with good value.
Electronics_5,2,OR,These are cute and my kids were excited about the color choices but we purchased two pairs and both hurt the kids' ears. They refuse to wear them anymore and we had to replace them with a different brand.
Electronics_5,5,OR,I tried using different types of smart charges but it never worked out for me. My N8000 took  forever to charge. This Pwr+ charger has been amazingly fast charger and now my charging time has reduced by 30%.
Electronics_5,4,OR,Nice Back pack lots of storage room in large compartment. wide wheel base makes it easy to pull over obstacles. Would have gave it 5 stars but the outer walls are not lined as in My Targus laptop backpack.

Electronics_5,4,OR,The screws that came with them do not fit my 12-24 drilled and tap rack fastener holes.  The shelves are nice but I had to go buy 12-24 screws from a hardware store in order to install them.
Electronics_5,5,OR,Great kit for cleaning your SLR. I used this to remove the oil spots on the sensor of my D600 and it worked like a champ. I like the little pen cleaners too and the blower is pretty solid.
Electronics_5,2,OR,"Adhesive isn't great (using in a vehicle where the temperature varies significantly).

The opening is also too wide for a single charging cable (iphone) and will not hold it in place.

Probably works fine for indoor use on larger diameter cables."

Electronics_5,2,OR,We did not have a lot of success with this product. USB devices worked better. As I recall we had some setup problems and well and it's still setting in a drawer in a desk someplace. Would not buy again.
Electronics_5,4,OR,"I like these cable ties, because you can make them the size that you need. Be careful not to put them too tight. I did once, & the end broke off when I tried to untie it. They fit tight."
Electronics_5,1,OR,This Optoma projector died after 2 years. I've been replacing 2 lamp bulbs in a year and now the color wheel went bad.  The noise of this projector is annoying and horrible. Don't waste your money on this projector.
Electronics_5,4,OR,"I've owned several of these (I lose them frequently), and I love them. They would be a perfect 5, except they come with the terrible U3 software, with no indication of how to remove it. Here is how to remove it:

Electronics_5,5,OR,"Great bag.  I've been using it for a month to haul purse/lunch/laptop back and forth to work, and it is rolling smootly and holding up fine.  Laptop pocket is padded well, overall capacity of the backpack is good."
Electronics_5,5,OR,I bought this cable to replace the one that came with my Sony Portable drive.  The mailman left the package on the front lawn and my dog ripped it to shreds.  This cable works perfectly with my drive.
Electronics_5,4,OR,"I did an install job with this in a 96 Land Rover Discovery. The cables made the length of the whole vehicle, they stripped easy, and made some pretty sharp corners. I will be using these again in future installs!"
Electronics_5,5,OR,Bought this to replace the Canon OEM cap when I lose it...it's just a matter of when. Pinch mechanism works well and fits just as well as original. Bought this for a Canon 18-135mm STM lens and would certainly recommend.
Electronics_5,1,OR,"This lens cleaner didn't work at all... My other car's CD rom skips a few seconds of each track and I was hoping this will clean the dust and thus fix it, but nope, it didn't do that at all!"
Electronics_5,3,OR,"The 'tulip' shape makes weird shadows, like a vignette, and you have to keep moving it until that goes away. Sometimes it doesn't go away at all. I would've rather had the round shaped lens hood but couldn't find one."
Electronics_5,4,OR,I like the fact that it does not have to be recharged so often and more for the fact that it works with all of my electronics. I am a gadget person and this is an awesome tool for me.
Electronics_5,5,OR,"Didnt know this particular adapter  was  a  dish network  stick
All in all  a good value  in lieu of getting an original Panasonice stick and paying 5 times more than this one.
Glad i bought it."
Electronics_5,4,OR,I like my transmitter  for the most part there isn't a lot of intereference like I had with my last one. Though there are still times that I still get it if I try adjusting the volume or heat.
Electronics_5,5,OR,They are inexpensive but are clear and seem to be well made and worth the price. Nice case to keep them in. Best part they are fulfilled by digital Goja an excellent company to do business with. Great customer service.

Electronics_5,5,OR,"Really good, comes with extension cord, and sticker. Packaging designed by fort knoxx, but looks nice. Sounds great, and looks good too. The microphone sounds okay, but I would recommend buying a snowball for any really intensive need for quality."
Electronics_5,1,OR,"I had previously wrote a 5 star review for this product. Sadly, after only 2 months the camera stopped working. I tried to contact the seller, but it appears that is not possible outside of the return window. Very disappointed."
Electronics_5,2,OR,I wanted to use it as a signature pad but it didn't work for my needs. It appears to function well for graphics arts but I'm not a graphic artist so I'm not an expert on how it should function.
Electronics_5,4,OR,"It works as advertised, so far (about 3 months) no problem.  I cover the screen while driving because it can be a distraction.  Once set, the camera comes on and records without any operator input, set and forget."

Electronics_5,5,OR,"The cable works perfectly in the feed for our cable internet, delivering over 60 MB/sec.  Good selection of lengths, so I was able to get exactly what I needed, without having a bunch left over to clutter up the installation."
Electronics_5,4,OR,"FEELS fabulous. Down marks for the metal case making the key clicks resonate and ring too much, and that the 10-key pad is IBM standard (with double size plus key) and NOT Mac standard, which is crucial for working in ProTools."

Electronics_5,4,OR,this particular one i had to send back because it was the wrong one. i needed it for Nikon. but this works perfect. make sure it says 1/8000 sync . because there is a 1/250 that does not work past 1/250
Electronics_5,5,OR,it does the job. the fans aren't any louder than the ones built into my laptop. truthfully i can't tell the difference in the sound. i would recommend it fully. it puts the computer at the right hight and angle too.
Electronics_5,2,OR,"I bought this antenna in hopes of receiving more OTA TV. But ended up only getting about 2 channels that didn't seem to work half the time. I switched to the Winegard Metrostar 2000, and have had a lot better success."
Electronics_5,4,OR,Have been using it for a week continuously. Great battery life and quality. Very easy to pair and use with devices. Noticed the audio drop when the phone is moves a lot. Would definitely not go back to a wired headphone!
Electronics_5,5,OR,This was purchased as a gift for our 19 year old who has a real interest in photograph. He has fallen in love with the Nikon gem and is rarely seen without it. Easy to use - great photos as well.
Electronics_5,5,OR,"These are Great! The battery lasts pretty much forever. Sound is excellent, noise cancellation is phenomenal! Range could be better but it's right on par with any competing headphones, I've just been spoiled by the old Motorola S11's."
Electronics_5,5,OR,"I used these by the millions (well, maybe not millions...). Not thick or super grip, but the extra length makes up for that. At the price of these you can use them everywhere. Also, cut them in half for smaller cords."
Electronics_5,5,OR,Seems to be well made. Terminals are slightly cheap on the inside but look like they will hold up fine. Installed a Skar 12 inch shallow sub in mine with some poly fill on the sides and the setup pounds hard!

Electronics_5,4,OR,"This is a good little case for the Nuvi. I gave it 4 stars because I think it's missing some protective padding if accidentally dropped or hit.
It should come with the Garmin Nuvi and should not have to be bought separately."
Electronics_5,3,OR,Buggy when setting up m. 2 wound up buying a pcie m. 2 extension card which defeated the purpose of this board. A simple bios update would fix it but a this is a dying socket type don't hold your breath.

Electronics_5,5,OR,Went from several years of Dish network toy to DirecTv and never looked back. We placed the RF boxes downstairs and change the channels from the piggy backed tv's with these controllers. They work great with the home distribution system from Amazon.

Electronics_5,4,OR,"I purchased this with the single intention of Vudu Disc-to-Digital.  For that purpose it works great.  It is a little loud for my taste, and heats up quickly. Which makes me glad i am not using it for other purposes."
Electronics_5,5,OR,"Very Very fantastic camera. Have other full size sensor SLR's and this easily holds its own. The Leica summicron lens with nano coating and digital filter is second to none. Can you say Value? Knew you could. A++++
Really wide angle as well."

Electronics_5,5,OR,Great Price for 2 batteries and a charger. Shooting video with a DSLR consumes a lot of battery and having extra ones is imperative. These don/t last as long as the Canon ones but are way way cheaper. I would Highly recommend them.
Electronics_5,5,OR,"The nicest cable I have ever used, and cheap! The wires fabric texture, light weight, slimness, and strength are the best I have ever seen.

Electronics_5,5,OR,Great camera.  I can use this to take pictures of my family and save the cost of having them professionally done.  Captures everything you need.  Nothing bad about this camera at all.  Excellent lens to go with this camera.
Electronics_5,2,OR,"Great idea, but way too weak of a light to use anywhere except a pitch black roan. Not practical for slide shows in a club or office environment. I returned it and spent four times as much on an entry model office projector."
Electronics_5,4,OR,I use these for mountain biking and the sound quality is adequate. The thing I really like about these is the ability to hear ambient noised. They are NOT sound isolating like most ear buds and that's exactly what I like about them.

Electronics_5,5,OR,Works great - I installed this on my daughter's computer for use with bluetooth headphones - no issues at all.  Her computer does have Windows 7 - which has somewhat complicated bluetooth configuration setup - but that isn't the fault of the adapter.

Electronics_5,4,OR,"This cable works exactly as expected. There is no signal delay, and no degradation of picture quality, even though it is really long.
Its hard to get excited about a cable, so I can't really say I LOVE it. But I would definitely recommend it."

Electronics_5,5,OR,I use everything it comes with and the best part is that there are more things in this that what I can even think of what to use it for. This product was purchased using a promotional code to receive item at discounted price.
Electronics_5,5,OR,This strap worked just fine while I was on a river ride in Costa Rica. It also strapped right onto the helmet I used for the zip-line course. It allowed me to get some great footage of my friends while on vacation. Highly recommend.
Electronics_5,4,OR,"The design is convenient for plugging in dc adapters (bricks).  The cord to the wall outlet is long and rotates at the surge protector.
I'll hopefully never find out how well it functions as a surge protector, but at least the specs are good."
Electronics_5,4,OR,"Works nice for storing my several SD cards for my DSLR and Camcorder - and helps to keep them separate.  More space/storage than what I need but works well.  And, it's got enough bulk to not get ""lost"" in my camera bag."
Electronics_5,5,OR,I must say I have been impressed with this device. The company seems motivated to continue to improve with several firmware updates since I have had it.  Easy set up easy to use don't hesitate if you are looking to cut the cord.

Electronics_5,5,OR,"I think these headphones are a pretty good deal, considering the low cost.  The blue LED doesn't really bother me at all and I think that having a volume control built into the cord is a great feature.  I'm very satisfied with them."
Electronics_5,5,OR,"Quality items.  I bought these for modding my PS3 60GB PHAT model along with a 120mm fan, to allow more air flow since those original models get hot and the internal fan sounds like a jet engine at highest RPM.

Great seller, and excellent product."
Electronics_5,5,OR,"Great case and great quality. I've used this case for over a year now and it hasn't had any problems. The quality is wonderful and I've gotten quite a few compliments on it. It's slim, sleek and doesn't make the tablet bulky. Highly reccomend it."
Electronics_5,5,OR,"It's a little bulky, but it is great in protecting the Kindle Fire.  I love the fact that you can easily rotate the kindle and use the case as a stand.  The magnetic closure is fantastic and makes the product easy to use."
Electronics_5,4,CG,"It does what it is suppose to do. Not too much to say, I'm just glad I bought it. I am using it with the TRS-80 and it does it's job well."

Electronics_5,5,CG,Cbus Wireless Silicone Cases are perfect for the iPad mini. I also love that the case is made of a hard plastic. The plastic is solid and is easy to clean. The case is made of a durable hard plastic.
Electronics_5,5,CG,"I tried a couple other brands of headphones with similar sound but they were all just too noisy and annoying.  I had to replace the headphones with these, and the sound is very good.  They are still going strong, I"
Electronics_5,3,CG,"This sounds good if you are an amateur with a sound bar.  If you are a professional speaker owner, you may want to look at some of the better brands.  I used these with a 50"" AM/FM radio"
Electronics_5,1,CG,"I got 0 stations. ZERO stations. The only stations I heard were from my neighbors. I'm not a big fan of the station, but I figured if you're in a lot of areas with a lot of stations,"
Electronics_5,5,CG,I was researching Bluetooth speakers and found the quality to be good enough. I have been using the Sony Bose E3500 for a year and have not had any issues with it. The sound is excellent.
Electronics_5,4,CG,"Generally, batteries are batteries, and this is the case.  I will admit that I have been using the batteries for about a year now, and they have performed consistently, so it should be no surprise that I still use them"
Electronics_5,4,OR,"Unfortunately this particular unit did not work in our walkies.  I'm putting at ""I Like It"" as it wasn't that it would work just the stems on the plug were too long for the particular motorola we use at work so I had to return."
Electronics_5,5,OR,"This was a well made case, good quality for a very reasonable price. It was a gift to hold a portable car dvd player (also a gift) and there is plenty of room for the whole system and plenty also for extras. Very happy with it."
Electronics_5,4,OR,"Nice laptop for a very reasonable amount of money, it came in pristine condition, the only complaint is that some of the description is not correct but if your are willing to put up with little thinks missing here and there it is a perfect laptop"
Electronics_5,5,OR,This mouse is helping me write this review as I speak. Works great.  The scroll button is the opposite of a normal  windows computer though. That always screws me up. But overall its flawless and works several  months on a set of batteries.
Electronics_5,5,OR,"This is my second purchase of the Infinity Kappa 693.91 3-way, 6 x 9 co-as speakers. They are great sounding in both cars (Corvette/Van) and can handle a lot of volume.  I would highly recommend them and would purchase them a 3rd time if needed."
Electronics_5,5,OR,"I love these speakers. They work well, the price is great and im actually ordering a second set. I use these with my iPhone, iPod and computer. The cords are long so I can put them whereever I need to and the sound quality is wonderful."
Electronics_5,5,OR,"Excellent power strip that meets many needs.
Specifically:
Wide spacing between plugs with two extra wide transformer receptacle.
Variety of USB power ports (2 ports for 2.4 A; 1 port for 1 A; and a auto regulating 0-2.4 A)
Six foot cable is a convenient length for a power strip."
Electronics_5,4,OR,"I bought this as my 'training' strobe.  It works pretty good for portraits and product pictures.
The only minus is that you only get full and half setting but it is easily overcome by moving the strobe or reducing exposure in camera (F-stop or shutter speed)"
Electronics_5,5,OR,"This subwoofer was purchased as an additional unit for a small 2.1 home theater setup. Used primarily to play bass-heavy music, this subwoofer absolutely keeps up with loud environments, and, coming from a pro sound background, is one of the best consumer subwoofers Ive personally heard."
Electronics_5,4,OR,"Works as described with a Samsung Galaxy S3 but as long as you plug into a wall charger.  Used it on a now 52"" legacy Sony XBR LCD TV & a new Pioneer LED LCD monitor TV at work via one of its HDMI inputs."
Electronics_5,5,OR,"I have an ASUS transporter tablet and my original cord when bad. I needed a new one and I order it through Amazon. I am very pleased with the cord, and if I ever need a another one I will definitely come to Amazon."
Electronics_5,5,OR,Just bought a couple more as back ups.  I really like this remote and it works well for what I need it for.  I emailed Audiovox and they confirmed that this is the exact same remote as the RCR314WR but this one costs less.
Electronics_5,1,OR,"Lenovo laptop power supply - plugged it into my Lenovo laptop and it shorted out my laptop power. Laptop dead. Returning power supply for refund. Sending laptop to Lenovo for service, at my expense.
I strongly urge you not to take a chance on this power supply."

Electronics_5,4,OR,Hello people I bought a Nikon p500 great camera and I wanted a carry cad for it and I got this one and it's perfect fit and it's not bad for the price so try it out it really good thank u have a great day
Electronics_5,5,CG,Works very well w/ my old ones and the materials are good.  I have a few of these in my living room and I am using them with the TRS-80 and other earbuds.  It does not work
Electronics_5,5,CG,Works great and best feature of this lens. I've used it for a couple of years and it's still working great. I also bought the T1i lens and it's still working great.
Electronics_5,5,CG,Glad I found this lens.  The wide angle is good enough.  The zoom is awesome.  If you want to get a DSLR with the full zoom you can get it with the 16-55mm f/1
Electronics_5,5,CG,I purchased this to plug into an AC adapter and it works great.  The only thing that is a little off is the plastic part.  The plastic part is a bit loose and that is annoying.  It will not stay in
Electronics_5,5,CG,"This thing screams!  It's a real professional quality product. It's also a very strong one. If you want to get your feet wet with the TRS-80, go for it."

Electronics_5,1,CG,"This device was perfect in that it was lightweight and comfortable.

The only reason I gave it 4 stars was the fact that the charger that came with it didn't charge it as fast as the charger that came with the camera."
Electronics_5,5,CG,"This is my favorite bluetooth speaker. The quality is amazing.

The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that the earbuds are too small and the sound is very loud.

Electronics_5,4,OR,the item arrived on time and worked as it was supposed to but my pda slipped and the little prongs broke so i have to use tape to keep it in til i can figure out how to get the broken prongs out and buy another one
Electronics_5,5,OR,"These are fantastic!! We've been able to DRASTICALLY reduce the amount of space our almost 100 Blu rays take up in our entertainment center. I HIGHLY recommend it, especially for those living in small spaces (like myself)!!! They shipped fast and appear to be good quality too."
Electronics_5,3,OR,This didn't work for my son's coffee pot so I should have ready a little deeper. He is in Germany and I sent this to him. It works fine for his phone and laptop but I had to order a heavier duty one for the coffee pot.
Electronics_5,2,OR,"Poor installation, did not apply well.  Lots of bubbles all throughout the screen.  I ordered another product from a different company and had to just take this one off and throw it away.  Just skip it and buy a different one, I recommend Coolreall"
Electronics_5,5,OR,"Nice design.  Opticall and mechanically, it works.  It is easy to attach and position on my iPhone and the optics are sharp.  If I were goingb to suggest a change,mit would be fo bayonet rather than screw-threads to connect the parts for faster setup."
Electronics_5,5,OR,Easy to set up and easy to use. I watch my dog all day from work on my iPad or my iPhone. I have two and will be buying a 3rd. If you ever want to change locations just plug it in somewhere else in your house.
Electronics_5,5,OR,"The August EP650 is an excellent over ear Bluetooth headset. It has excellent sound quality, good bass, mids, and highs. It even has a mic built in so you can accept phone calls while wearing them. They sound a metric ton better than the overpriced Beats brand."
Electronics_5,5,OR,"I needed a long HDMI cable to hook up my HP laptop via a DATAPORT->HDMI adapter to the TV set, and this works perfectly.  Now just have to figure out how to make it transfer audio too from the PC to the TV via that interface."
Electronics_5,5,OR,"This has been very useful to me. I tossed out my netgear wireless router, and replaced it with a raspberry pi. This unit lets me have a single plug for the raspberry pi, since it can power it, and other peripherals such as a wireless access point."
Electronics_5,5,OR,really nice case.  We purchased a chromebook for my 5 1/2 and 7 year old daughters and they love the color.  It holds the tablet and cord well and even has Velcro to connect the handles.  Very happy with the purchase; reasonably priced too.
Electronics_5,5,OR,Charger works well. The headset drops right on or sits on top if the case is closed nd charges reliably. I liked that I could just throw the case (with headset inside it) and off I go. Unfortuntely very unhappy with the headset but loved the case.
Electronics_5,5,OR,These Ethernet patch cables are one foot in length and the ideal size for home patch panels. The shorter cables make your panel much cleaner looking. The boots on the cable ends make it easier to pull the cable without the release tab hanging on another cable.
Electronics_5,5,OR,Easy to install. Seems like excellent protection for my 8 year old son.  comes with a black plastic insert that you must remove to install an ipad. I think the purpose of the black plastic insert is to hold the shape until you install the ipad.
Electronics_5,5,OR,"Very easy to use.  I plugged the unit into the ethernet jack, ran the configuration utility, and it was visible / accessible to Windows 10 and Android devices.  The DLNA feature works well, allowing me to stream stored videos directly to my LG Smart TV."
Electronics_5,5,OR,"Please note that the USB ports have 2.1 amps current available between them. That means two 1 amp cell phones charging or one iPad or Tablet. But NOT a cell phone AND an iPad or tablet. And certainly not two tablets. For the price, it's a win."
Electronics_5,5,CG,"For $99, this is a bargain. The quality is good, but not spectacular. I have one in my bedroom and the other in a garage. The sound is not as great as other earbuds I have tried."
Electronics_5,5,CG,Ordered this Item to use on a trip to the beach.  I did not want to throw the camera away.  The camera is solid and works well.  I was very pleased with it.  It is a good value for

Electronics_5,4,CG,Awesome been having it for a couple weeks now and it works great. The only downside is that it's very small. I bought the TRS-80A as a replacement for my older model.
Electronics_5,5,CG,These do not give me a real advantage as long as I keep them close to the screen and they do not have the same strength as a desktop keyboard. This is a great keyboard. It is light and easy to operate.
Electronics_5,5,CG,Nice little case. Other reviewer's mentioned it as being very comfortable but it's not. I don't use it much but the phone works great. Not too bulky or bulky. The case is nice and it fits well.
Electronics_5,5,CG,"We have had no problems with it, and it is a great product for the price. I highly recommend it. If you are looking for a basic cable, this is it. The quality is great and the price is great."

Electronics_5,5,OR,Got this to replace a little cheap video card that did not support my four computer monitors well. This video card is GREAT and my computer does not lag as it did before with the cheap alternative. This is still low-end but it's great quality for the buck!
Electronics_5,2,OR,"Seemed to be ok as far as a tablet computer goes. If the sound output was better, it would be a much better tablet. You really need powered speakers or headphones to get good sound. It amazes me that Asus has not corrected this problem on other models."
Electronics_5,5,OR,"This gives both HD video and HiFi audio when plugged into my Galaxy Note. Resolution is the full 1280x800 pixels of the phone display. HD videos played with DICE Player look great. And it costs next to nothing. delivered overnight by amazon Prime, a perfect transaction all around..."
Electronics_5,1,OR,"Avoid it. The top portion is made of plastic. No matter how I adjust, it will not stay leveled. You will need to get a separate ballhead to mount your camera. The mounting screw is too recessed. You will need to carry a screwdriver to mount a camera."
Electronics_5,5,OR,This is a very powerful and strong little holder!  Garmin does it again! It doesn't shift or loosen with use or when manipulating the GPS.  It's the bomb-diggity! Not to mention that it literally costs pennies!  How can you  not love that! (smile) Enjoy!
Electronics_5,5,OR,Remarkable clarity and sensitivity. Controls are easy to understand. USB or memory card swap makes it easy to transfer sound files into PC for processing. Fits in a shirt pocket so it's handy when you need it. Very well thought out control sequences. Outstanding product for the price!
Electronics_5,5,OR,"OK, they're couplers.  They have one function, to join 2 cables that end in male RCA jacks.  They do it.  The fit is snug and the contact is positive.  The color coding is a convenience that's nice to have.  Red for right, eh."
Electronics_5,4,OR,"On a multiple item order, item was received a week prior than all other items order shipped under the same property.  It is little oversensitive on the mouse movement.  I'm sure there is a sensitivity adjustment but haven't spent the time to look for it yet."
Electronics_5,5,OR,I bought this so that i didn't have to buy a new stereo and it was the best decision i ever made! It has all the functions i expected it to have and more! Its easy to pair and not i have bluetooth functionality in all my cars!
Electronics_5,4,OR,I prefer the sound of these to the A5+. I think the A5+ is over hyped compare to these. With these you can skip a sub woofer if you live in an apartment. I couldn't afford to keep these thou because the price is a factor to me
Electronics_5,4,OR,"I had first purchased a much smaller bag thinking that I kid meet my needs, but it wasn't even large enough to hold two charging cords.  The depth of this bag allows me to bring all related cords for my three devices with me when I travel."
Electronics_5,5,OR,It is pleasantly smaller than expected. The hooks fit the headphone strap but they don't dwarf my headphones like I thought they would. The thing itself it more flexible than I expected. It's not alarming but I just expected cast aluminium or plastic but this is soft rubber.
Electronics_5,3,OR,"The connector on the enclosure seems like it won't last very long and isn't very secure.  It would work well enough if I'm using it at a desk where I'm not moving around much, but I doubt it would work well using my laptop at an airport."
Electronics_5,5,OR,"Highly rated by MaxPC, so I bought it, and works at stated speeds.  I have a 6 year old RAID of 4 120gb SATA2 SSD's that still works faster, but the single drive is less hassle to set up with this less issues, and TRIM works automatically."
Electronics_5,1,OR,The device stopped functioning after the first use. Changed battery a few times but would not power on or record audio when attached to the camera. The build felt cheap and I regret not saving a little and going with something a bit more expensive with higher quality.
Electronics_5,5,CG,Super easy to install but not a huge deal.  I will keep my review for a couple months.  Great product!Works great.  The sound is crystal clear.  The ear cups are well padded and the outside cover is very thick
Electronics_5,5,CG,"I cannot understand why anyone would do that.  I've tried other Bluetooth speakers, but the speaker is so small that it's not worth mentioning.  I think the reason I bought this speaker was to replace the old Bluetooth speaker, which is"

Electronics_5,5,CG,Great and easy to use. I love the feel of the lens. The zoom is awesome. If you want to get a DSLR with the full zoom you can get it with the 16-55mm.
Electronics_5,2,CG,i was a huge creative decision. The design and sound is fantastic. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that the front of the speaker is slightly too tall to hold it up properly. The only way to get it to stay on is

Electronics_5,2,CG,"got this item, could not find a better quality product.works great.Nice little speaker!  Works as advertised.  The only thing I wish is the cable was a little longer, but it's a little longer than I thought it would"

Electronics_5,3,CG,"Ok it is faster to use than the stock Garmin. I will keep my Garmin in this one.I bought this for a friend, and he is very happy with the purchase.  The only thing I wish it had been a little bit better"
Electronics_5,3,CG,"In short, it's smaller than some of the other cases I've tried.

The only downside is that it's very hard to mount.  The plastic mount is a bit difficult to mount with the bottom of the case on the floor"
Electronics_5,1,OR,"I've already returned this case. The bottom piece would not say snapped on at all. The keyboard cover was great and the colors of the case were vibrant and really flashy. If the bottom piece was fixed, this case would be great. But as it is? Save your money."
Electronics_5,5,OR,"I tried it once and as soon as was able I bought it. It is a bright portrait and street lens. It focuses very fast and has a nice bokeh. It is light, you don't even feel it in your camera! This lens is a must in your bag."
Electronics_5,5,OR,I love this product....I am a photography student with the thought of going professional and this was nice and vibrant just like the one in the studio at school.  It came to me wrinkled but I stretched it out and let it hang and they are coming out.
Electronics_5,5,OR,This battery works great!  I'm so glad that it's still available for purchase.  My old Coolpix battery died 6 years ago and purchasing a replacement back then was really expensive.  I'm so glad prices have come down and I get to use my old camera again!
Electronics_5,5,OR,"I have the dual harness, and neck straps which I also love. I love this wrist strap for when I'm on the go (shooting live music mostly). It's nice for times when the harness is too much, but gives me the piece of mind of not dropping my camera!"
Electronics_5,5,OR,"Good sound- for earbuds, of course- the remote function is cool. Does take some practice figuring out what's the difference between 'Vol up' and 'Play'. Almost blasted my eardrums once trying to skip songs! Still, a standard pair of in-ear headphones with a cool remote and good price point."
Electronics_5,5,OR,"The budget alternative to intel i7-4770. It runs cool, crunches 1080p 60fps rendering and lets me play gw2 with little to no lag. All for the same price as an i5. Don't let the xeon name fool you, this server processor can easily handle itself in the consumer environment."
Electronics_5,4,OR,"Loved the camera! Very easy to navigate and easy to learn!
The whole package was great! Only problem was the camera stand, it broke as soon as I took it out. But other than that, I love the quality of this camera.
Attached are pictures that I took using the camera!"
Electronics_5,5,OR,Item works as advertised. Good for baby monitoring and/or watching property. Quick delivery and works great. Small but looks like a normal clock. Motion Activated. Easy playback. Company has contacted me several times to be sure I was happy with their product. Company appears to stand behind their product.
Electronics_5,4,OR,"Works well enough for what I use it for (as a test server). I'm tempted to get something else similar, perhaps a NUC with Core i5 instead, for a family member. It works really well, is quiet, and you can put it anywhere as long as it has ventilation."
Electronics_5,5,OR,This is a great active adapter. I purchased a radeon r9 390 that didn't like my HDMI to DVI cable I had been using on my old card for my separate monitor. Since switching to this adapter things are working great and both of my monitors are correctly detected.
Electronics_5,5,OR,I have had these for a while now and I got to say I love the bass on these earbuds. I don't like paying a lot for earbuds since I have bad luck in getting them crushed or snagged on something. I would definitely buy another pair of these.
Electronics_5,5,OR,"Product works Great!!!  I seriously came home seeing a box and I was like, what the hell is this?  Then after opening i couldn't believe this part was already at my door!!  It was seriously there like 12 hours after i ordered it.  Wicked Fast..."
Electronics_5,5,OR,"Works Great, Got this for my kids room, since the TV is mounted on the wall it makes it easier for them to change from XBOX to PS3 and to the fire Stick.

I purchased this for free or a discounted price to use, and to give my unbiased opinion"
Electronics_5,5,OR,"Surprisingly, this flat piece of plastic (with silver inlays) actually works, bringing in all 19 available channels in my area. However, you really do have to find the sweet spot on your walls for it and that might require a longer coaxial cable than is provided with the antenna."
Electronics_5,4,CG,Awesome back cover but front cover has the wrong feel. I will return this for a replacement.Great product. Great price. I am using it with the TRS-80 and it does not disappoint. It is a good value for the money.
Electronics_5,4,CG,"Really nice case for the price. The only problem is that it comes with a small screw driver. It's not very sturdy. The case also comes with a ""turning case"" that you can either store the case in your backpack or use it"

Electronics_5,5,CG,"I don't have much to say about the case, just what it is for. I have one in my office and the other in a garage. The sound is great. The case is made of metal and it is very light."
Electronics_5,5,CG,"I would have to say that this is the best part of the product, just the way the speaker is placed.  The plastic part is very clear, and the cover is very sturdy.  The only complaint I have is that it seems to be"
Electronics_5,5,CG,"These drives (16 GB and 32 GB) are very quiet.

The drive bay is pretty small (about 8.5"" x 8.5"" x 4.5"" x 2.5"" x 1.5"" x 1."
Electronics_5,4,CG,"Case smells bad upon arrival, and it's a very comfortable fit.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that the plastic part is too small to fit comfortably inside the case, but it's a little smaller than the size of the case"
Electronics_5,5,CG,"Actually, I'm more impressed with this than the other cases. I'm not sure if the screen is the screen protector or the screen protector, but it is the screen protector. The case is thick and it is hard to get a good grip on"
Electronics_5,5,CG,"I love the length!

I have had this for a year and I still love it. I have one in my car and the other in a garage. The sound is crystal clear and it's nice to have a little extra in the trunk"
Electronics_5,2,CG,Here in AZ. where we are an island with lots of parks and lots of wildlife. Great product. Great price. I am using it with the TRS-80 and it works just fine. It is a good value.
Electronics_5,5,CG,This case is GREAT for the money and the materials. I will keep my eyes peeled for the next one.I had a lot of trouble with the TV and the cover was very flimsy. It was hard to get the cover to come off.
Electronics_5,5,OR,"As most of the others have said, this lens is awesome. I got it and with in the first 10 minutes I was taking some of the best portrait shots I have taken to date. If you have the $ even if you need to borrow it, get this lens"
Electronics_5,5,OR,This seems to work as advertised; it has helped me pick the USB cables that transfer current/voltage the best.  Hard to believe that there can be such a difference in cables.  It also showed me that my 15' USB extension drops no voltage - which was pretty amazing!
Electronics_5,5,OR,"I purchased the case recently to setup a DDR2 gaming PC and it setup very well with a sharp look.

I will attach pictures if I can so anyone interested can see. By the way, the case is big enough to fit a decently large Heatsink in... Which is just awesome."
Electronics_5,3,OR,"This case has a nice feel, but is rather bulky and does not protect it from falls.  As I learned the hard way, dropping your iPad on one of the corners using this case will cause the screen to shatter.  This offers no real protection to your iPad."
Electronics_5,4,OR,"Definitely not commercial grade, but it worked fine for my house. I've used a small variety of keystone jacks, and they have all worked.

If one side of the jack is not all the way in before putting the other side in, it can get wedged, which is a minor pain."
Electronics_5,3,OR,I'm afraid it wouldn't last long - wires are too thin they should be made to be more durable! The main idea of buying this item was to replace the other set one ear bud of which failed after about one year of use because of the same problem ....
Electronics_5,5,OR,"It works.
Thankfully, haven't had to use it.
It's small. Palm-of-hand small.
But if you're in the middle of trying to find you way out of the Great Quake of 2017 here in Southern California, I guess the last thing you need to be carrying around is some sort of enormous Boom Box."
Electronics_5,5,OR,What can you say about this....it was basically new and it came with the orginal box and all the connections not bad for a used item I got it for my mom she wanted something to watch movies on I got her a Bluetooth keyboard with it and she's happy.
Electronics_5,5,OR,If you are looking for a great bargain on UHF antenna this is your choice look no further buy two of these and either wire or solder them together and hook up a matching transformer that goes from double lead to coax and you are in business perfect crystal-clear reception.
Electronics_5,2,OR,I purchase this sleeve when I purchased my Acer 15 inch Chromebook and it does fit the laptop just fine but because of the large size it should have handles as it is too large and too heavy to one hand it like you would a tablet in a sleeve.
Electronics_5,5,OR,Perfect for my intended use. I did not purchase this for anything camera related but rather for my Nintendo 2DS with the Trigger Grip. It fits perfectly and even allows room in the other compartment for 3DS folding headphones and charger. A complete travel pack for my 2DS and accessories.
Electronics_5,5,OR,"I just received it today, tried it for about 1 hour with my new camera: Canon 60D, ir works like a charm & love it :). It looks nice & very good quality. Responsed exelent. If you need it, just buy it & you will not have to return it."
Electronics_5,5,OR,"Fantastic bag! I looked at and purchased a few other laptop bags from Samsonite, Incase, etc. and nothing comes close to this. They use YKK zippers, have multiple pockets with soft lining to not scratch up laptops, iPads, etc. and this case has plenty of pockets but not too many!"
Electronics_5,5,OR,"Seems to work well.  I bought it for a camera that had been modified for astrophotography work.  It takes care of the color change that modification causes, and does it without having to mess with the white balance settings.  Makes the camera useable for normal (non-astro) photographs."

Electronics_5,5,OR,Were having many problems with my 8 year old laptop with only 2GB of ram while using Adobe Lightroom.  I was seriously planning to replace computer.  With only this small and cheap upgrade it is a 100% improvement.  I can now wait a little longer to replace computer.
Electronics_5,5,OR,"This was a gift (I knew my neighbor wanted it), so I can't say for sure. My husband helped with the installation and it worked fine, so I'm assuming everything was as expected. Hard to rate something like a cable. What can I say? It looked perfectly stable, like a cable!"
Electronics_5,2,OR,"This case is well designed for the original version of the Pro because it's single viewing angle matched what the OEM stand provided. On the Pro 2, the second viewing angle is very help, but the build of this case eliminates it as an option without removing it from the case."
Electronics_5,4,OR,"The genuine article, as promised.  You never know when there are so many knockoffs out there.  This is an item where the cost of the genuine Dell thing wasn't much higher than the cheapo knockoffs.  I always make sure the seller for this sort of thing is Amazon.com."
Electronics_5,5,OR,Was thinking about getting a AirPlay device but decided on getting this Bluetooth wireless mobile speaker. It sounds great and is easy to set up. I was worried about sound quality of Bluetooth vs AirPlay but it does not seem like an issue. Also Bluetooth will support devices beyond Apple products.
Electronics_5,5,OR,I first viewed this receiver at Best Buy and after thinking about it I ordered it off Amazon.  Free shipping and a slightly lower price.  Well worth the money.  It produces wonderful sound.  I've been using it mostly with my blue ray player and it really rocks.
Electronics_5,5,OR,"First item received was disfunctional. I was able to get a replacement keeping the old battery for the other remote and expedited shipping for free
This will work but if you have a case over your lens it will not.
Great for landscape timing photography and distance photos for family party and friends"
Electronics_5,5,OR,"I bought one of these lenses used off of eBay. While it would be nice to have a higher maximum aperture than f4, this lens is ridiculously sharp, and having the full frame equivalent range of 24-105mm is really nice for a lens of the size of a typical kit lens."
Electronics_5,3,OR,Amazon wanted me to rate this product but I have not had the time to use it in the installation of the Boss subwoofer.  The star rating is only because the computer system requires one.  Hope to install the subwoofer with the wiring harness over the July 4th weekend.
Electronics_5,3,OR,"This cable probably functions properly with certain devices.  Between my Mac Mini and my Mitsubishi Projection TV, it did not, best I can see is because there is a sync issue that one or the other do not support.  The cable itself lacks shielding on the final component leads."
Electronics_5,3,OR,"Great sleeve except it's so snug that you wouldn't be able to fit the surface in it with the keyboard on. I have to remove the keyboard and put it on the back pocket. Other than that, I love the design, material, magnetic closure, and the designated loop for the pen."
Electronics_5,1,OR,"This extension cord was the perfect length. However, my computer was unable to receive power through it. I disconnected this cord and reinserted the original power cord and the PC powered right up. I added the Tripp Lite cord back and no power again. Maybe I just received a bad cord."
Electronics_5,4,OR,"Works perfectly. My only qualm is that it has more ports than I need, but it was the best value of the options I reviewed so the extra ports don't bother me. Who knows, maybe I'll need them in the future - and not I have them just in case."
Electronics_5,5,OR,I am really pleased with the whisks and glad I ordered them. As for their appearance I like there warm cheery colors and the handles are comfortable in the hand. They perform well while using them and cleaning them is a breeze. They will not harm the coating on your skillets.

Electronics_5,4,CG,This case was a good buy. The quality is good. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that the plastic part is too small to fit comfortably inside the case. The case is made of plastic and the plastic part is too loose.

I had to replace the screwdriver with a plastic one to get it to work properly.

I will update this review as it becomes available."
Electronics_5,5,OR,"Bought this for my son who is third grade. He uses it with supervision and is able to navigate on his own for his homework and research. It's versatile and he can do any work that he needs. Paired with the key board, he is pleased. Performance is good enough for him."
Electronics_5,5,OR,"I'm using it right now. It's just the right size for my hands (I wear large gloves). Of course it's not going to fit into your palm, cuz it's small, duh. But it's easy to hold by the fingertips. The buttons and scroll wheel have nice, satisfying clicks and it slides easily."
Electronics_5,4,OR,"These are packaged a bit weird, can be a little bit annoying trying to get these in and out of the container they come in. If you intend to store these elsewhere then there's no problem. I believe I saw these cheaper at HomeDepot and Walmart. But these are still OK priced."
Electronics_5,5,OR,"this little camera takes great underwater pictures, so clear...even in the ocean off Florida.  Takes great regular pictures as well. Daughter loves that it is water proof and shock proof. Its the perfect size. Not too big and not to small. perfect.  works well for her without breaking the bank"
Electronics_5,5,OR,"Works Great. I have two 23"" 16x9 monitors mounted on the stand.  Probably works best with matching monitors.  Might throw the balance off otherwise.  There is no independent monitor height adjustment, so same sized or matching monitors are best.  Works on my glass desk with the stand option."
Electronics_5,3,OR,"Bought this mostly for ham bands listening due to its ability to capture SSB which does actually work well.
One down-side is it only contains 80, 40, 20, and 15 meter ham bands.
It does however pick-up both CW and SSB signals.
I wonder now however, if I should made the investment in ham receiver."
Electronics_5,5,OR,"This insanely cheap router outdoes everything else that is under $100. It can handle streaming movies and multiple games at once no problem. I imagine if you have a family of 4 or more all using devices maybe you would hit some caps, but it has been nothing but great for me."
Electronics_5,5,OR,"I've had my ThinkPad for about a month and love it.  I'd had a 19"" Dell and find this 15.6"" light and maneuverable.  The keyboard is smooth and enjoyable to type on.  Have had no problems with wireless or internet connections.  All of my downloads have gone flawlessly."
Electronics_5,5,OR,Purchased these to conceal wires for a wall mounted tv and it worked perfect! It even comes with a template you can trace right on your wall for fool proof instillation. Of course make sure you have a stud finder and drywall saw or other appropriate tools to get into the wall.
Electronics_5,5,OR,"I use these headphones with an MP3 player on daily walks. They are comfortable, stay in place because of a snug fit, and sound good on all types of material, especially audio books. And, of course, you can hardly beat the low price; so I can unhesitatingly recommend them."
Electronics_5,5,OR,Product was instantly recognized by the latest windows 10 build. Connects to the 5ghz channel on my router flawlessly and keeps it's connection. The only driver i had to install was for the bluetooth feature which was painless and quick. Also to note it's connected via AC wireless protocol which is great!
Electronics_5,5,OR,"My 8 year old uses this for his iPad mini. It's been dropped a few times and it's helped up well. Didn't want to spend so much money on the otter box, since I needed to buy 2. (His brother also was gifted an iPad mini) Glad this worked out for us."
Electronics_5,5,OR,"The wife dropped our iPad 2 and the digitizer completely shattered. Most folks think it's the screen, but the screen actually sits down below this. It took quite a while to remove all the broken glass, but once I did installation of this was simple. Looks almost like a brand new iPad."
Electronics_5,5,OR,"Works fine.  A note for Techs,  this cable is thin.  If you cut the cable a RJ-45 crimps on but its a bit loose.  It did work fine in the end, but really shouldn't be cut for custom lengths.  I really should have just used bulk cable."
Electronics_5,4,CG,"Great too for travel and use. The only problem is that it's kind of hard to find.I bought this for a friend, and he is very happy with the purchase.  The only thing I wish it had been a little bit better for is the battery"

Electronics_5,1,CG,"Worst streamer I have ever had. The quality is just too poor. The only one I can think of that is the Apple TV. The TV is not HD, it's a HD TV. It's not even a 1080p one."
Electronics_5,3,CG,"Quality right on target for a new lens. Not too much to say, I'm just glad I bought it. I am using it with the T1i lens and it's amazing. It's a good value for the money."
Electronics_5,5,CG,"Never done an iPad screen before. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the one time I read the reviews, I thought it was the iPad itself, not the keyboard. The only thing I can say is that I am very pleased with the keyboard."

Electronics_5,4,CG,Used this to connect a pair of speakers to my TV. Works great for the price. Great product. Great price. I am using it with a TRS-80 and it works just fine. It does not work with the Roku.
Electronics_5,4,CG,"As a budget priced radar, it's an excellent value.

The only drawback is the extra batteries. I had to replace a couple of batteries that were not in the case. The only drawback is the battery life. I would recommend it for the price."
Electronics_5,5,CG,"I bought these for several reasons. First, the sound is better than my Sony A7000. Second, the mic is nice, but the clarity is not great. Third, it's a bit too heavy for my taste.Fourth, it's not very compact"
Electronics_5,4,CG,main reason i got this is because the case is a bit large. It's been one of the worst cases i've ever owned. The plastic case is so thin it's barely noticeable. It's not even a thin case.
Electronics_5,5,CG,"I have had nothing but good luck with the Garmin. I will keep my Garmin in this one. I bought this for a friend, and he is very happy with the purchase. The only thing I wish it had was a usb port."
Electronics_5,5,OR,"The ear buds filter out ambient noise very well and the inline volume control means that I can easily change volumes quickly and on the move. I wear these at work (10 hours a day, 5 days a week) and barring accidents I can count on these lasting me 3 months. Love 'em."
Electronics_5,5,OR,"The set costs less than just a ploarizer, and there are instructions on the internet on how to modify them easily to fit the z990. (Just use an emory board nail file to take off a tiny bit of the outside thread all the way around. Took 5 minutes and they work great."
Electronics_5,4,OR,"I really recommend buy this headphone. Excellent sound output at this price. There are 2 reasons for me not giving this product a 5 star rating is..

1) Little too bulky although collapsible.
2) There is no microphone built with it. Other products like Planotronics have microphones along with the headphone at the same price."
Electronics_5,5,OR,"I absolutely love these headphones, I am wearing them as I write this review. They may be the best headphones for under $30 on the market. They are not very bassy, but I don't listen to very high bass music anyway. They are great for listening to rock, classical, podcasts, and audiobooks though."
Electronics_5,4,OR,"Make sure 6 feet is enough for your needs depending on your desk/table/office features, I bought this lock because of my Mac's Kensington Security Slot but didn't pay much attention on the length.

If you have to go all the way around you desk/table to lock you computer, this is not the best option."
Electronics_5,3,OR,"Does not have the infrared leds as was pictured.
Has 9 hours of recording time using a 32GB SD class 10.

I like the layout of the function buttons, much easier to navigate than some competitors cams.

This will make a useful addition to my video / audio recording capabilities.

Thanks again Amazon for quality and value."
Electronics_5,2,OR,It works out of the box. I was happy for a while until I pause the music and notice the massive static white noise this device is generating in the background. Then I disconnected the receiver from my speaker. My speaker is quiet again. I was hoping for better and returned it soon.
Electronics_5,4,OR,"The mount is made out of metal, well made. The problem I have is the only two screw holes are set on a diagonal. I needed to mount it on the back of a cabinet and needed horizontally aligned holes. Now, its mounted on an angle, which is not all that bad, actually."
Electronics_5,5,OR,"Love the headphones.  Very easy to operate (as I would expect most these days would be!) and the sound quality, for someone who's not a ""pro,"" is really great.  I like how the speakers themselves swivel so that they will fit perfectly.  Very impressed and I would recommend to anyone."
Electronics_5,5,OR,"I bought this item so I could hook it up to my camcorder to get the audio from the convention on FM and eliminate the crowd noise (Babies crying, high heel noise, etc.)  It works perfectly.  I bought two of them so I could monitor the recording and still be mobile."
Electronics_5,5,OR,"Great card. Thanks to the review posted by other users, I already knew it will work with Linux. Plugged it in and I was surfing in a minute. Great replacement for the on-board NIC that went bad in my laptop. No need to install any drivers or re-boot in Linux."
Electronics_5,5,OR,"...or any of the other 'slim' Powershot pocket-sized cameras that are the same size.

It fits in snugly and provides great protection. The case is well padded.

The carabiner on the one we received is elongated rather than round as shown in the picture here. It comes off if you don't want it on there."
Electronics_5,5,OR,"While there's not much to truly get excited over concerning a replacement snap-on lens cap, this one is well designed and does exactly what it should. It is easy to properly secure to the front of the camera lens and stays in place until removed.  I'll give this product ""FIVE"" Amazon stars!"
Electronics_5,5,CG,an excellent point and shoot. The wide angle is good enough to make a small portrait shot. The range is good enough for a small portrait shot. The lens is large enough to make a portrait shot in a large room.

Electronics_5,3,CG,"The piece is ok as it has the wide opening for the lens holder, but the holder has to be closed.  The plastic part needs to be opened to get the lens holder open.  The opening is not in the camera, so it's not really worth it"
Electronics_5,5,CG,"I'm pleased with the power cord. The only problem is that it's kind of hard to find. I bought this for a friend, and he is very happy with the purchase. The only thing I wish it had was a usb port."

Electronics_5,4,CG,"This is a decent cable.  I have an old router that does not have a hard drive, and I had to replace it.  I also have the cable hooked up to a router that does not have a hard drive.  This was a deal breaker. "
Electronics_5,5,OR,"I bought this case a while ago for my Macbook. I loved it. It was durable and protected my Mac. The stand was also a plus on flat surfaces. Unfortunately, with age it broke. Also if you don't clean it often crud will pile up and it's noticeable because this product is see through."
Electronics_5,4,OR,"I used these to nail some rg-6 coaxial cable to the wall and keep it out of the way. There's a bit of space, so maybe a 6 mm cable clip would've been a better option for the cable I'm using. But I couldn't beat the price, and it works well enough. Can't complain."
Electronics_5,3,OR,"I want to love it, but FM has too much static. An antenna connector would be nice. I cant read the markings on the buttons and they are dirty already showing on the orange rubber. The mini sound card slot does not work. These problems are just mine, they should not bother other people,"
Electronics_5,4,OR,Instruction suck. But I went online and afyer figuring it out I love it. The only bad part is you have to change setting in the camera (Canon) and if your target moves and you just want to use your shutter you have to change it back in menu or tou're in timer modr
Electronics_5,5,OR,"Super easy to set up with GPIO pins and runs the screen and the Pi off on power cable if configured correctly.
I use this for running kali linux on the go. The onscreen keyboard is decent, but I much prefer using a usb bluetooth remote.

The screen came flipped, but was very easy to change."
Electronics_5,5,OR,Worked instantly on a MacBook Pro (mid-2017) while using it in conjunction with an Anker USB hub. No config needed and automatically defaulted to priority over the laptop's wireless connection. The only thing I don't like is the repeated blinking light when plugged into a USB hub when the laptop is no longer present.
Electronics_5,5,OR,"This is a replacement lens for the one I lost/misplaced. I purchased two just in case I lose/misplace it again. This time, I'm using one of those elastic holders and glueing on the cap! Not much I can say except that it's just like the original and that's all I can ask of it."
Electronics_5,5,OR,"This is a well designed case. I love the way it feels and will protect the iPad air. It just seems sturdier than most other cases and will not slip off a table if bumped by a grand kid (extra bonus for me). I will be shopping this brand for other things, I think."
Electronics_5,3,OR,Serves it's purpose but we actually took the plastic piece off that covers the lens because my daughter felt like it was making her pictures more blurry and unclear. The only reason she wanted it was for the selfie mirror anyway to make sure that she would be getting her face in the picture.
Electronics_5,2,OR,This worked it syncs with my phone but short of it ringing when my phone rings that all it was good for. It did not sync with my calendar and when someone calls their name dose not come up on their phone number. So I gave to my 6 year old to play with.
Electronics_5,3,OR,Was a bit cumbersome to use. Didn't realize I needed the battery pack that stored more charge. Two fully charged batteries died within 10-15 mins of use. I can't totally fault to mount but wish there was some kind of indicator on the adapter to let operator know how much charge left in battery.
Electronics_5,5,OR,Great feature in that you can move the arm to another place with the second sleeve that can be put on a second wall.  Put one sleeve in my kitchen and one by my TV in my livingroom - avoids having to buy two in order to have a stand in both places.
Electronics_5,5,OR,"LOVE THIS calculator!!!  all the functions OMG~~~ one thing tho, make sure that your kids don't get it. it will ruin them.

Electronics_5,4,CG,"I hooked it up to my old AC adapter and it works great.

Electronics_5,5,CG,"Super compact, fits in laptop pocket. The only problem is that it's not really a screen protector.

Electronics_5,1,CG,"Sound quality was good however, it has the quality of a good lens.

Electronics_5,2,CG,Does this thing charge USB ports?  Not anymore. My computer is a Lenovo Yoga 4. 0 and I had to replace a USB port with the USB one. I plugged this into a USB port on my laptop and it was working fine.
Electronics_5,3,CG,"I don't love these. I use them as an external HDD for my computer, and I have them in a external hard drive for the most part. The sound is okay, but it's not worth the price. It's not a perfect sound, but it's worth"
Electronics_5,2,CG,I like the nice generous stylus and the long battery life.  I have a few of these on hand and the phone works great.  The battery life is good too.I bought this to replace an old Kindle Fire which was defective.  This one is still working
Electronics_5,5,OR,"I bought this product a year ago. I got the pink one and it's  quite eye catching. But beyond that, it does what it promises to do. Nothing changed with the product and it does protect my Ipod touch. It's sturdy and comfortable to use. I will recommend it to anyone."
Electronics_5,5,OR,"Works extremely well. Previously I had crappy ones from Walmart (constantly deleted my files, never working, etc.). This works perfectly. I have had it for a few months - not one issue. The boxing it come in is super professional (it looked like it was from Apple lol). Very high quality feel, design, and performance."
Electronics_5,5,OR,"Wow so glad this popped up to rate! I forgot what I had that I liked, for the past year have had a struggle finding one as solid (not wobbly, not easy to break, truly one handed) ... And now I can finally return the latest piece of crap I got and get this again!!"
Electronics_5,5,OR,"Excellent sub. Plenty of power and distortion doesn't seem to be a problem for this thing. It hits the low end very well. Very clean sound. Easy to hook up. Well made, if rather large. I didn't think it would be as big is it is. Looks nice. I would definitely recommend it to anyone."
Electronics_5,5,OR,"This card is very fast. With other cards, including others from SanDisk, when shooting stills with my Olympus E-M1 I'd have to wait for the image to save. With this card saving is instant. Highly recommended. It *may* prevent camera lock-ups *if* the lock up is being caused by slow writes when shooting in bursts."
Electronics_5,3,OR,"Only a little moisture shuts these down, and the earpieces need replacement immediately for comfort.  They do sound good and are loud.  The changeable chamber caps do make an incredible difference.  I would suggest Sony or Klipsch earpieces and dry ear canals.  For a workout these should be rated no stars."
Electronics_5,2,OR,Got it to work finally. Can't hear much if any difference. First tried it on cheap FM radio and all I got was static and hisses. Then tried it on Kindle Fire and could hear no difference. On mp3 player maybe some volume but hard to really tell. Bottom line I can not-repeat-not recommend this.
Electronics_5,2,OR,"Very nice radio, except I can't see it during the day time.  The glare is unbelievable and it's so dim it can hardly be seen.

At night it's great, if not a little too bright.  The dim adjustments are not adequate for day/night.

Other than that it's a great sounding radio with plenty of features."
Electronics_5,5,OR,"I knew what I wanted before I ordered from Amazon, and I must say their service was excelent. The Sony CD/DVD player does everything I expected from it, and the HDMI works well with my 42"" Plasma HDTV.The price for the Sony was reasonable, and the shipping was fast. What more could I ask for."
Electronics_5,4,OR,"I ordered this not even thinking about the chance of it not fitting on the front fans of my Antec 900 since there's 2 walls protruding on the sides of the front of the case. I got it to fit by cutting at it though. I wouldn't suggest doing it but hey, it works now!"
Electronics_5,5,OR,"Small and very sturdy piece of hardware.  This device is the unmanaged.  This is all I needed for my last port available on my router.  Once the switch was hooked up I wired the 65"" smart TV and the Blue Ray so that we could view movies on Vudu.  Simple setup."
Electronics_5,1,OR,The SensorWand 14mm has a straight shape that makes it difficult to secure a PecPad on it. Similar wands from other vendors have a waist. Put a tape over pecpad around the waist line and pecpad does not slide. But with this wand pec pad has a tendency to slide off and quickly gets loose.
Electronics_5,3,CG,"Great little card holders for the money, and very comfortable.

The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that the plastic part is too small to fit comfortably inside a case. The case is made of plastic, and I would think it would be OK to extend the case"
Electronics_5,5,CG,Bought this camera for my daughter to use with her iPad 2.  She loves the photos and the quality.  I've used it with my iPad 2 and iPad Mini 2 and it's been a great camera.  I'm a bit skeptical about the quality of the camera

Electronics_5,5,OR,"My new Canon 6D Mark II has a touch screen. Everyone always thinks that they will never scratch or damage it, and then we do. This isn't an absolute protection, but it sure will ward off 90% of the stupid things that a guy will usually do as he puts a big scratch on the glass."
Electronics_5,5,OR,I'm using this power supply in my HTPC setup and I love it. It's whisper silent which it great for when I'm watching movies on my TV. My old PSU sounded like a wind machine of some sort. I'm very impressed with this power supply and strongly recommend it to anyone looking for a quality PSU.
Electronics_5,5,OR,"32 GB-  holds a LOT of pictures and movies! Took this to England with me for an 8-day trip, took more than 700 photos and quite a few videos, and still have room for more. This is definitely the way to go! But don't forget to back up your files after you download the photos."
Electronics_5,3,OR,This is my second Rockville purchase and both seem to be decent quality. However this unit seemed to be beat up slightly and came with no instructions. Possibly used. The unit is lighter than I expected but definitely added extra power!  I've attempted to contact customer service several times with no success and is discouraging.

iPad requires another transformer. Be careful."

Finally ordered a Motorola modem and my LAN works fine.
Electronics_5,4,OR,Bag is much smaller than picture will have you think. But description to the product. Is spot on. So keep that in mind. I was able to fit into my bag: One camera/one lens/ (5)memory cards/ (3) batteries./ (3) filters and your out of room. Numbers are for safe carry nothing bulging or crammed into bag.
Electronics_5,3,OR,"Be Careful - this will not work with your Toyota if you have the Navigation system.  The Navigation disc in most Toyota cars use the port on the back to connect the DVD player (data) to your radio.  Therefore, there is no place to plug this in....  Recommend calling them first before ordering."
Electronics_5,5,OR,Comfortable pads that fit on the outside of the ears. (not on top so it doesn't crush the ears) The mic is clear and crisp. The sound is premium. Lots of play room so it's not squeezing my head as I have ran into in the past with other headsets. GREAT product and not too expensive.
Electronics_5,3,CG,"I purchased with a Sony receiver. The only problem is that it's not a stereo. If you have an external mic, you must mount it in the wall, so you have to reach down and either look at the outside or the inside. If you have an external mic, you"

Electronics_5,2,CG,The product is great but it has the quality issues you'd expect from a brand name. The other two I had were the Apple iPad and the Samsung Galaxy Note. I wanted to go with both and the Kindle Fire so I was thinking about going with the Fire.
Electronics_5,4,CG,This case does the job. I love the materials and fit perfectly. The only thing that is a little too heavy is the plastic case that is around the edges. I would definitely recommend this case to anyone. I would recommend it for anyone with an iPhone.

Beats the gopro official solution for battery - and you get an extra charger.
I have to say: i do prefer not using the camera to charge the batteries and this is a good solution for extra batteries."
Electronics_5,5,OR,"Great quality. I've only had it for a few weeks now, but you can feel the quality in the carefully crafted tips. The cable is tangle-free as stated of course and the cloth jacket is of good quality. Now it's just a thing of seeing if they last longer than my last cloth jacketed aux cable purchase."
Electronics_5,4,OR,Looks good and secure. However opening cut out for screen just a little bit small. So when you try to use touch screen functions its a little tight to get to those sections. A place for a stylist would have been a plus and a slot in the back for your hand when using as a reader.
Electronics_5,5,OR,Very inexpensive solution.  Highly recommended for spare or for hobby use.  It does what you would expect it to do.  The compression is also excellent.  When properly tightened it gets nice and stiff just like the much more costly solutions.  I highly recommend this for a backup or for a primary .
Electronics_5,3,OR,"It is a bit more light weight than I thought it would be, all in all, it is a very sturdy tripod. Although, there was an excess amount of lubricant on it when it first came. I use this with my canon T3i and am able to add a mount with an LED light and mic to."
Electronics_5,3,OR,"I have Senn 598's which are open-back, and I bought the 439's fully expecting them to be inferior in all ways but bass (since they are closed back). However, even in the low frequencies these headphones were significantly inferior. They may shine on their own, but they just can't compete with 598's. I ended up returning them."
Electronics_5,5,OR,"For the price, this is it man. The cards do sometimes fall out when i open it, so keep it facing up when you open it. I thought 8 cards would be enough, but I quickly found that i needed a bigger case...so if you have a small gig where water may come into play, get it."

Electronics_5,5,OR,"I bought two of these a couple of months ago. Although some comments about stylii in general made me apprehensive about scratching the screen on my iPad, these have not.

Electronics_5,4,OR,"I should start off by saing that my speakers are pretty big and they are hanging at a odd angle.  The mounts did get the job done, but not too sure on if the weight rating is as good as they say.  I think they are one of the best choices in the price range."
Electronics_5,5,OR,"I needed a long extension and a good quality cable and this fits the bill.  It actually sounds better than the 3 ft one it replaced that cost 5 times as much!!!  Thank you parts express.  And PS, any cable will break if you stress it.  Please be fair when rating these cables."
Electronics_5,5,OR,I ordered this product based on other positive reviews that I read and I am happy to say that it works great. You get what you pay for. Even the bulb setting works perfectly. I recommend this wireless shutter for anyone who wants a great accessory for their camera but can't see paying Canon outrageously overpriced fee.

Electronics_5,5,OR,"I bought this product as well as the TP-LINK AV500 powerline starter kit. Both are great products and can recommend both. One thing to keep in mind, they will be no better than the internet you have coming from your router.
I did a YouTube review on both. If your like to see the video here's the link https://youtu.be/yhxNzGU2Nq4."
Electronics_5,5,OR,"Great Product. Works well with little fuss and is cheap enough to buy several for your home. Reliable, quiet, and compact. Please note this is not a battery backup UPS but simply a line conditioner. It provides the same protection as a UPS just does not provide battery power in the event of a total loss of power."
Electronics_5,5,CG,"It's been four years since I bought the case, and I still love it. I have one in my office and the other in a garage. The sound is crystal clear, and it's worth the price. It's a little thin, but it's not too big."

We was going to order a new one for $89.00 from Samsung but really thought why would we put that much money in a 4 year old laptop, saw this one for less than $25.00 shipping and all. We made a great choice."
Electronics_5,5,OR,"This is the one you want. It has verything I want in earbud protection. I bring my earbuds with me and my Kindle everywhere I go.

Electronics_5,1,OR,"From the first time I turned this thing on, it skitzed out. Jumping screens and buttons without even touching the tablet at all. Won't connect to the wireless connection that I know is working because I'm using my iPad on that connection to type this. Even for the money, it's crap. Spend a little more and get something better."
Electronics_5,5,OR,"I travel a lot and needed something compact that provides extra outlets and USB connections. This worked perfectly.

Update: 2017
I've owned this product for almost 2 years and its still holding up well. I've used it on every out-of-town trip I've had since its purchase (50+ trips) and its the most important accessory in my laptop bag. Would recommend again."
Electronics_5,4,OR,It works with my 2008 Apple Mac Pro running Snow Leopard.  The reason I did not give it 5 stars is that the back light only flashes for a second when connecting to the Mac.  It does not stay connected but does reconnect fairly quickly after a keystroke or two.  Perhaps this is to save power.
Electronics_5,5,OR,"This six foot cable is reasonably priced and well designed.

The Samsung card is perfect in my cell phone.  The card lives up to the hype of a class 10.  Highly recommended...will not disappoint."
Electronics_5,5,OR,"I purchased this device because I needed additional ports for my MacBook Air.  This is a well made hub, is working perfectly, and certainly looks like it goes with the system.  And it interfaces well with my USB 3.0 backup drives which is also extremely important.  It would imagine that it would also work for Windows systems."
Electronics_5,5,OR,"Sweet, works great! When plugged in it always defaults to VGA which is a little annoying to need to press for HDMI, but not complaining. It's very useful to be able to switch display with the push of a button. As with all of these cheap brand accessories, the quality is lacking but be gentle with it and it'll last."

Small size
Power supply built in
Great sound

Cons:
None so far"

My only issue is that the retraction button doesn't work as well as my previous set. It's a little annoying that I have to press it so hard and now it's really slow. Other than that a great product.

Electronics_5,3,OR,It is okay due to its low price point. It does what it wants to do but the main issue is the white rings. After constant use the white rings loose attachment to the legs and fall off. I recommend saving up a little more to get a Joby Gorilla Pod. However this is still a wonderful few time use product!

Electronics_5,4,CG,This bag is well made and has the quality of a good bag. The dimensions are just right for my needs. I am using it with the TRS-80 and it is comfortable and well protected. The zipper is very thick and the flap is very large. I love it.
Electronics_5,5,OR,"The item is exactly what is describe.  So I am giving 5 stars.
But, be aware,  it will have to be placed on the item where you may want to use the item with the adhesive backing.  Be sure to have a place that will be okay to attach with adhesive.  I placed them on the back of my nightstand."
Electronics_5,5,OR,Switched from the New Balance Runner. What a difference. It takes me 10-20 seconds to sync most of the time (that was my problem before). Charts look great on Garmin Connect. The screen size is just fine and the watch is pretty small and thin which is great for those runners that don't like weights on their wrists for runs. I highly recommend.
Electronics_5,5,OR,"My family and I drove twenty-two hours to our vacation destination and it was a must to have DVD players for our three children. These are perfect for the price! It held our DVD players through bumps just fine. I really have zero complaints about it! Anyone needing a good, solid, DVD player should definitely look at these and give them a shot."
Electronics_5,5,OR,"This is a great product, I used it on my Samsung Google Chromebook because they do not have an ethernet port all I did was plug and play. With this great product you can use it for any type of Netbook which doesn't come with an ethernet port, with this you will have the access that you need when WiFi is not availible"
Electronics_5,3,OR,"CD player died after 3 years of very light usage. I suppose that's just how things are being made these days (My CD walkman from the 90s still works) but I'm extremely disappointed that I paid $50 for something that should've cost me $20 (No battery backup? Really?) had horrible quality speakers, and was extremely bulky, only to have it break so soon."
Electronics_5,4,OR,"I was reluctant at first to buy a plastic cooling pad but this one actually works quite well. I bought it specifically for the Xbox 360 to cool it down. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a cheap way to cool your laptop  or as I am using it; for my Xbox 360.

Electronics_5,2,OR,"I am getting to hate them even though I have 3. As noted by others they can give a false open reading. This is not good since it is designed to trigger other functions in a system. I have had other Aeon products go stupid so if your playing there kinda cool. If it is a critical application, just don't do it yet."
Electronics_5,3,OR,"I didn't like this all to well. It just had a slow reaction whenever I made any kind of move with the mouse (and yes I did every thing on my part to insure the bluetooth and settings where on point). I only gave this 3stars because I did buy this as a used mouse, I guess with any product never buy used......"
Electronics_5,1,OR,This card stopped working after 8 months.  I could no longer write to it. I could not format it any longer either. PNY did do an RMA on the device but because of sensitive information that I stored on the device I could not return it. I shredded the device and decided not to trust PNY for any of my memory needs.
Electronics_5,5,OR,"this is a good buy for anyone who is looking for a replacement mic. mine broke on my laptop and this was the best product for what I paid for it. was kind of skeptical at first the price was too low, but decided to buy it anyway since amazon has never let me down. I'm very happy with my mic, Thanks seller."
Electronics_5,5,CG,"Perfect case. I won't go into specifics, but it is a great product for the price. I would not recommend this product, unless you're looking for a cover for your camera that will protect it when not in use. I was thinking about buying a case for my camera for the holidays."
Electronics_5,4,CG,This manufacturer definitely gets the job done and the materials are good.  If you have a larger head you may want to consider this model.  The sound is great.  I would definitely recommend this model to anyone.  I would recommend it for anyone with an average sized head.This is a great product for the
Electronics_5,5,CG,Very glad I ordered these. The quality is good. I also like the fact that the case is adjustable. I am using it with the TRS-80 and it is comfortable. It is a good value for the price. I bought this to replace a broken one I had.
Electronics_5,5,CG,"there are a million different brands of headphones out there. I will admit that I have been pretty spoiled by these headphones. The sound quality is good, the clarity is good, and the ear cups are comfortable. It's a little pricey for a pair of these, but you get what you pay for."
Electronics_5,5,CG,This SSD was on sale for a little over $30. The drive is a solid performer. I had a lot of trouble with the drive and it took a lot of time to get it to work. I am very pleased with the performance. I would definitely buy from this company again.
Electronics_5,4,CG,"This unit works as advertised. The only problem is that it comes with a small screwdriver. If you want to use a small screwdriver, you'll need a screwdriver that is bigger than this one. I would suggest using a small screwdriver to hold the screwdriver securely."
Electronics_5,5,CG,"Sits on my desk under my desk and the cord is thick enough to hold my iPad. It is so small that it doesn't bother me much, but it does take a little getting used to. It does not stay in place when I hold it in my hand. I love it."
Electronics_5,5,CG,This is an update to a number of the previous version of this product that I purchased.  The new version was the best I could find and is the best I could find in price.  The only complaint I have is that it was a little hard to set up.  The first time I used it I was
Electronics_5,5,CG,"I learned the hard way that it doesn't work in the cold.

The only way to get it to work is to run a 32-bit OS, which is how it's supposed to work in the Windows 7 machine. If you are going to use it in a full desktop environment, you'll have to"
Electronics_5,1,CG,I bought this to for my wife and she loves it.  She also loves the way the speaker is so small.  I am using it with the TRS-80 and it is amazing.  It is really good sound.  I wish it had an option to have the volume up to 2.0.
Electronics_5,3,OR,not sure how i feel about these.... not sure if i want to keep or smash with hammer.... my ip security cameras seem to have a really hard time staying connected. my router alone has no issues however but the router cannot reach all four corners of the house. nothing else is connected to these extenders so it should have optimal signal and bandwidth.
Electronics_5,1,OR,"With most new devices (including the Fire) being made with gorilla glass, these screen protectors are an utter waste. Sure it may reduce some glare and smudges, but the glare reduction isn't that significant. And your money would be better spent on a nice microfiber cloth (which can also be used for other cleaning purposes) to clean the screen when it does get smudged."
Electronics_5,5,OR,"Got the product yesterday, and tried it with various DVDs that I have - they all work very well. It is convenient and light weight, I can carry it around within the house, since I use it to watch some of the piano-teaching DVDs that I purchased. The remote control is also convenient to use, and the picture is clear and color is bright."
Electronics_5,5,OR,"I've bought my fair share of replacement lightning cords over the years, and Anker is THE BEST. I stand by their products and I won't buy anything else anymore. They're durable and reliable, and they come in a huge variety of lengths and colors and styles. This 1ft cord is great for power banks and laptop connections, etc. Five Stars - would definitely recommend!"
Electronics_5,5,OR,"Have been using this mouse for around 4 years now. Has served me wonderfully through thousands of games of League and countless hours on minecraft. This mouse senses any damn surface you put it on; carpet, pant leg, bare desk, whatever. It even worked semi decently on a glass top table. Still works great. Gets a 5-star because it fits a $10 pricetag WONDERFULLY."
Electronics_5,3,OR,I bought this unit for the bedroom. I was looking for something that would work with my Ipod. This one does as advertised but only using the original Ipod cord. I tried a USB extension and a 30 pin extension. Neither would work. In the end I used the 3.5mm connection. Other than this annoyance I like the unit. Good value for the price.
Electronics_5,5,OR,"Recently we upgraded to this cable modem in order to satisfy Suddenlink's requirements for their unlimited internet service.  The modem was relatively easy to set up and has performed as expected.  We have a couple of laptops, two i-Phones, and two Roku receivers that access content through the modem. This is our second SURFboard modem and we have been happy with both."
Electronics_5,5,OR,"This is a great bathroom radio.  It's moisture resistant, compact, and fairly attractive.  More importantly, the controls are very easy to operate, even with wet hands, and it sounds very good.  It has a weather band that is very useful.

I think it would be hard to do much better than this for a bathroom radio, and I recommend it most highly."
Electronics_5,4,OR,"I read some negative remarks on the pack but thought it was a good choice considering it had over 200 positive remarks.  For $48.00 I couldn't have found a better bag.  It has plenty of room  and the quality seems to be pretty tough.  It's not a 250.00 tamrac  but for the money I would say
it's a better buy."
Electronics_5,5,OR,Used this on my first build. Very quality product and included hardware. Looks good. The Included fans look great and are very quiet. I had plenty of room for my equipment on the inside. Lot of room for additional fans. I added 2 more and found magnetic dust shields to fit over the unused open fan holes. Corsair makes quality products. Highly recommend it.
Electronics_5,5,CG,"I bought this for a few reasons, 1) it is a nice piece of equipment, and 2) it works very well.

Pros:
-Highly adjustable angle
-The angle is adjustable and adjusts to your head.
-This lens is excellent.
-It is a bit smaller than I expected"

Electronics_5,5,CG,"FAR FARRR FARRRRR From ""Professional"".  I have an iPod touch and it works fine.  I just use the external microphone and the front microphone.  The sound is crystal clear.  The earbuds are comfortable and sound good.  The size is perfect and the volume level is good. "
Electronics_5,5,CG,"i was used a anker and it works fine. I will keep my review in order to share my experiences. The only thing I can say is that if you are looking for a quality speaker, look no further. I will be sure to update this review. Great for the price."
Electronics_5,5,CG,Amazing RAM. I've been using this for 3 years now and I'm still happy with the performance.Great product. Great price. I am using it with a TRS-80 and it's working perfectly. It's not a huge improvement from the original unit I had.The device does not work with Android 8.
Electronics_5,5,CG,"Used it to install on my old Macbook Pro. I did not need a hard drive, but I wanted a new computer. The drive was in the package, so I purchased it.

The drive is in good shape, and it's going to last for quite some time. I'm looking forward to using it"
Electronics_5,5,CG,"used this unit to replace a standard 3rd party HDD.

Electronics_5,5,OR,This is the 2nd order.  I returned the 1st order as it was defective as the battery would not hold charge and the battery is not accessible to replace.  This unit works great.  Not in the original packaging and not manual but it as all the cables that came with it originally.  The manual is easily obtained on the Garmin website.
Electronics_5,5,OR,It works great!  Only thing you need to know is that most laptop computers do not generate enough voltage in their USB ports to power the data transfer to the radio.  I used an old tower computer with the USB built into the motherboard. That has enough voltage to make the serial data transfer work to/from the radio.  This cable is fine!
Electronics_5,5,OR,"It's true the instructions are lacking, but it's one of those things that would be easier to learn by watching someone do it. All the people crying about it's difficult to do it without two people, probably have a chimney that's hard to reach, or aren't that bright, neither should reflect on the product itself. I installed them easily by myself in under 20 minutes."
Electronics_5,2,OR,"It worked as advertised, decent range, good sound, easy setup.  after almost two years it started making a horrible hissing sound when a device connected to it.  should I be happy that this lasted that long?  considering how cheaply everything else is made these days maybe so, but still not satisfied that now I need to shell out again for a replacement."

Electronics_5,5,OR,"Took some figuring out how to line up the handles and holes with the screw holes on my TV (32"" Coby), but I got it work. Plenty strong to hold the TV. It's great that I can push it relatively flat to the wall when not in use or pull it out and rotate it a bit depending on where I'm sitting in the room"
Electronics_5,1,OR,"All the zippers have broken off. Awful build quality. Poorly organized. Both the worst backpack AND the worst laptop bag I've ever owned.

Also, there is basically zero extra room in the bag. You have space for a large laptop, and maybe a power brick. A couple pens, if you're lucky.

Overall, it's just awful. I hate this thing and wish I'd never spent money on it."
Electronics_5,3,OR,"This is part of an alarm system and you need one if you have a garage door.
The plunger needs to be set different,there is no need for it to have to good as far up in the unit as it does.
You have to get it set so it pushes all the way up. There is no lee/way on this.
I got it ok after three tries."
Electronics_5,5,OR,"I have a Windows Surface Pro 2, a Kindle Fire, and an iPad. This Acer Iconia is a welcome addition. It's lightweight, easy to hold when I use it as an e-reader.

Electronics_5,3,OR,"Probably is better, but unfortunately there is nothing to compare. First, glued matte film stylus so slow. The corners and edges have to poke several times to get the result (can, of course, is the property of the film is). Second, the style is very rough, I would like in thinner. In general, the first experience with the use of this gadget is not impressed."
Electronics_5,2,CG,I was able to use this transmitter and the controls worked perfectly.  I have a few of the other two Bose speakers I have connected to my TV and the first was a large fan that came up when I moved the tv around.  I then turned on the speakers and the volume was a bit lower than I wanted it
Electronics_5,5,CG,We live in an area that has a lot of noise. I have a small home and we have two small speakers in the house. The sound is great. I can hear it through my speakers. I am not sure about the quality of the sound. The volume is a bit too loud.

Electronics_5,1,OR,"The clip on this tripod is EXTREMELY tight, and is EXTREMELY CHEAP. i.e. two exposed metal bars. Imagine two exposed metal bars clamping onto your iPhone. Right, it will damage your phone as it did to my iPhone 6+. The clips on this tripod left two permanent indentations on my iPhone! WTF. Ruined my otherwise perfect iPhone from a $15 tripod...

AVOID THIS PRODUCT AT ALL COSTS."
Electronics_5,5,OR,I used to have a Linkys router and thought my internet service was bad because my wifi would work for a few days and then drop. I got this router and have had zero drops and the speed is fantastic. I have all of my computers and devices hooked up to it and I stream Netflix through my Wii all day with no issues.
Electronics_5,1,OR,These speakers cause a performance issue in my PC.  When they are even in the room performance drops down significantly and many applications will not even work.  It fried one of my hard drives.  Altec says nothing is wrong with them even though they are much farther then 3 feet away from the hard drives.  Stay away from them at all costs.
Electronics_5,5,OR,"After a great deal of evaluation, we narrowed my daughter's belated Christmas/Birthday present down to two Sony cameras, the RX10 and this one. My wife and I have Canons and Nikons and others, so we were somewhat surprised to learn that Sony rules the roost in a couple of camera segments. Our daughter likes it and her husband was so impressed that he got the RX10."
Electronics_5,5,OR,I purchased several new monitors for my business only to find that the simple task of connecting the new ones was not going to be as simple as I thought. Most of my computers (HP Z210) have one display port and one dvi output and the new monitor had only vga and hdmi inputs. The handy adapter worked just as I needed so all is good.
Electronics_5,5,OR,"It's fast and durable. It fits well on my key ring but most of all, it writes and reads data quickly. It would be great if it was a little smaller but I guess one cannot have everything that he wants. I would certainly buy again. It's great to have 64 GB available at all times since I am able to carry it everywhere I go."
Electronics_5,5,OR,Bought 2 of these to mount TV's in our house to free up space. These were a great deal were really easy to set up came with a HDMI cable and a level that came in handy. I read some people had issues setting these up took me about an hour to fully mount 2 TV's they are so easy you don't even need the manual.
Electronics_5,1,OR,"This thing was lame. It didn't even work when we got it. It's really light weight and feel like it's cheap. We ended up going to Best Buy to by a different one that would do the job right. The bad thing is we waited too long and when we wanted to send this thing back, it was already too late to get a refund."
Electronics_5,5,OR,"Cable worked great!  Unfortunately, I didn't measure correctly, about 15 feet to short but this was my mistake,  I can't repeat what ""Walter"" would say because someone might block it, but I was one.  It's ok, I will give this one to my sister and I have already reordered a 75 foot Ethernet cable which will give me the correct length I need."
Electronics_5,5,OR,Got this bag it has been working great.  it is the perfect size for a 15in laptop with a notebook and a laptop power cable.  It has a different material on the bottom of the bag which is great as it will not get scratched.  I use the Metro rail and bus system to get to work and this is a great bag.
Electronics_5,4,CG,For the money this was a great lens. I've used it for a couple of years and it's still very good. I also bought the T1i lens and it's still good. It's a little pricey for a lens but I don't think I'll be getting a higher quality one.
Electronics_5,4,CG,"I love how it scrolls and has the ability to expand the lens.

The only downside is that it's very small.

Pros:
-Highly adjustable zoom
-The focus ring is very precise
-Fast aperture
-Great price
-The aperture ring is adjustable
-The aperture ring is adjustable

Electronics_5,5,CG,"First off the person who asked me the questions, I was a little surprised that the person said he wasn't impressed with the design, but that the basic design of the unit is pretty nice. The only complaint I had was that it came with a USB port for connecting the device to the TV. I could have just plugged it in"
Electronics_5,5,CG,This was smaller than I expected. The only problem is that it comes with a small screw driver. I had to replace the plastic part. Not sure if it was a problem with the screw driver or not. It was a little pricey for what it is.I purchased this device for my sister to use as a remote control for her
Electronics_5,1,CG,I realized that it did not have the right adapter. I tried to turn it off but the speaker is so small that it would not fit in the TV. This was a mistake and now it is stuck in the TV. I am very disappointed. I bought this to replace a broken one I bought for my TV.
Electronics_5,5,CG,I enjoy listening to hi-fi music. The quality is good but it's not great. I'm using a pair of ear buds for a portable desktop and the sound is not great. I bought this to replace an old Kindle Fire which was defective. This one is still working and I am glad I purchased it.
Electronics_5,5,CG,"Clearly this is not an issue with the case, just a design issue that is not covered by the warranty.I had a lot of trouble with the TV and the cover was very flimsy. It was hard to get the cover to come off. This was an excellent purchase.I bought this to replace the TV I had installed in"
Electronics_5,4,CG,"I used the product last week and it works very well.

If you have a larger head (like me), this will be a good investment.

This is a great earbud.  It will be your perfect size for listening to music on your phone or tablet.  I used it with a portable player and"
Electronics_5,2,CG,"I was excited to get this set, as it is a great deal for the price.  The other two I had were the most expensive and the sound was not so great.  The sound was terrible and the sound quality was horrible.  I would not recommend this product.  I would recommend to anyone with a portable player,"
Electronics_5,4,CG,Not bad for the price..The sound quality is very good.  The only reason I gave it 5 stars is because the phone is a bit small but the sound is good.  The earbuds are comfortable and the Bluetooth is a bit better.  I use it on my phone with no problems.  I love the fact
Electronics_5,4,OR,"Have had the SMC router a short while, but it is doing a good job getting decent signals out to my remote office. No complaints.

Now have had it 4 years and it still gets the signal out over a wide area. Tech Service was very helpful in working out a glitch involving HughesNet compatibility (turned out to be HughesNet's problem).

I will buy again if ever need to...."
Electronics_5,5,OR,"Nice little hub - great for my USB port-challenged laptop. Delivers what's expected, although you can't bus-power more than a few peripherals at once. Works well with both Mac and PC, and I like how you can switch the ports on and off manually.

Overall, a great unpowered hub - if you want to charge multiple devices at once, get something powered instead, but this delivers what's promised."
Electronics_5,5,OR,"I was skeptical at first, but it's a good little speaker for the price. I use mine out in my garage where I don't need Bose speakers while I'm doing wood working. As an added little bonus, it will shut itself off if you disconnect the Bluetooth for too long. I forget to turn it off on a regular basis, but it can save its own battery."
Electronics_5,2,OR,"The fit is alright but the clips are not keeping the earbuds well inside the ear. As a consequence you get a lot of the outside noise which makes the sound quality very poor in noisy environment (even when running on a treadmill). People will also hear what you are listening too. So except if you're at home or in a quiet environment, forget about these earphones."
Electronics_5,5,OR,Nice quality and it worked well for our online wedding ceremony! We set it up on a fireplace mantle behind the officiant and it picked up all our voices well. The mic was hooked up to a hidden Linux netbook that recorded the audio while a camcorder recorded the video. Sound and audio were then fed into a Webex session. No complaints on the audio at all.
Electronics_5,5,OR,I figure if verbatim makes a great dvd-r why not a great cd-r so I ordered it and I was not dissapointed. The hundred pack is just what I need and I haven't made a coaster out of one yet. When comparing prices I found it is cheaper to order the hundred pack which records just as good as the fifty pack of the more expensive ones.
Electronics_5,5,OR,"Okay; homemade security camera? Check. Raspberry Pi media center? Check. Printer Server? Check. Hidden low power storage for the security camera? check that too. Unified way to power it all without a mess of cables? Now I can check that off too.

It works and works well. I have 4 Raspberry Pi based devices and 2 Unifi APs running of of this so far with out any issues."
Electronics_5,5,OR,"Great mount to hold either a cable box, DVD Player, or Bluray Player. We combined this with the adjustable VideoSecu TV Mount and they look great together. What is also nice is the arms on this bracket are adjustable to accomodate all ranges of media sizes. Highly recommend if you just want a way to mount a peice of media without have to have a full shelf."
Electronics_5,5,OR,"I LOVE LOVE LOVE these headphones!  They perfectly keep out the noise (on an airplane, on the subway, etc).  I love that it has a switch so you can allow the surrounding noise come in.  That way if I'm on a plane I can quickly hear announcements or when I'm working in the office, my wife doesn't sneak up on me and scare me!"
Electronics_5,3,OR,"The grip isn't tight enough for an iPad that isn't in a case, also the unit can rattle while driving. Finally, I find that my toddler constantly kicks the unit when an iPad isn't installed. More than once she managed to turn and screw off the back with her foot. A better system would hold the screen between the seats away from toddler feet and rattle less."

Nevertheless, if you have USB3 and you're looking for speed, I'd recommend it."

Definitely recommend."

Kindle_Store_5,4,OR,"Well J.T. Fox hit every romance book must for me:

Angst-check
Hot men-check
Steamy sex-check

All of the above nicely rounds out the story of Eric and Jordan, two football players looking to finally stop playing games when it comes to love.

Eric is a hot shot quarterback that is use to getting what he wants. Jordan is the up and comer, who knows all about Eric Higgins, including his sexual preference. When these two are finally in a room together, there are nothing but fireworks. Super sexy fireworks between them.

I loved how forceful Eric came off at first, with Jordan giving back as much as he was taking. Even the banter between these two was scorching hot. Both men are on the down low while their careers are in the spotlight, however they still want to take a chance on each other.

Playing Hard was a quick sexy read that left me wanting much, much more. As I read, I knew things couldn't be this easy for two high profile football players looking to stay in the closet, and I was right. J.T. Fox gives us an excellent first book to the Hot for Him series.

Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"Fast Diet is the best weight loss book I have read in a very long time. It has a practical approach and it is not full of unrealistic goals that are impossible to keep, like most of the diet books out there. I have been searching for the diet to work for me and after a lot of books with unrealistic methods and goals, I have finally found one that I believe will work for me. I showed my mom this book and this is the same weight loss approach that she has been using and she has been losing weight very steadily. I'm so excited to start. With no major holidays coming up, I'm going to start immediately. Another thing I really liked about the book is how the author tells more about herself and her life than just the diet period. It makes it so much easier to relate to. The cute pictures were just an added bonus. I loved it and will share it with my friends and family. If you haven't gotten it yet.....

Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"I received this book free for review. I am not being compensated or influenced.

I could not put this book down. I devoured it in a matter of an hour and a little bit, and it blew my mind. Devlin is by far one of my favorite male leads of anything Ive read this year. Hes strong, smart, sensitive and tough. Hes been held prisoner for years, but some seriously nasty villains, and despite torture and terrible things happening to him, he remains true to himselfa healer not a fighter. Which just makes me so happy.

Jamie is another great character, she grew on me pretty steadily throughout the novel. I really love their chemistry together, and the fact that the female character was the stronger in the relationship. Devlin is not an alpha malebut it works so well with Jamie who pulls him out of everything and works to make their world better. This is the fourth book in a series, but it didn't feel like I was coming into the story mid-way. Characters from previous books show up and are mentioned but theres enough context to determine who is who without giving away their stories."

A twist of fate brings them together again under life and death circumstances. Can they find the strength together to survive and the courage within themselves to be honest with each other.

An Inescapable Attraction is an engaging western romance that is set in the time period following the Civil War, but before the turn of the century. Through her descriptive writing, Sydney Jane Baily has done a superb job of bringing each character, and their surroundings to life. Her characters are not perfect, and there are moments that they are not even very likable. However, through all of Ellie and Thaddeus' trials and tribulations, both not only mature, but they each work out their differences and come to loving trust that will insure their HEA.

I really liked this book. Granted, the sexual content was descriptive, but it was not graphic. That said, I would have enjoyed it much more without the religious expletives.

I received this book for free from eBook Discovery. I voluntarily post this review. This is my honest review."
Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,My oh my looks like Dr. Hugo is about to get the rest and relaxation he needs and what better place than at Wiccan Haus. On the way he meets Aislinn who is going going for the what if because until now nothing else has worked. Oh and she does not want to have anything else to do with doctors so Hugo best be wary. Added to the lovely mix is also Punda who is drawn to them so this author takes you with them to weave her special blend of magic to give you their story here. What will soon be discovered though for Aislinn will be hard to break but with the love she can receive from these two anything is possible.

Punda will also get more than she asked for or thought she would need but after you get to know her what she will get is perfect. Great battle with the winners taking the prize.
Kindle_Store_5,4,OR,"This short story focuses again on Luke and Simon and serves to show just how strong and lasting their love is.

""I've loved you since the first moment you kissed me to shut me up. Nasty tactic, as I can't object when I've got a mouthful of your tongue. There has only ever been you since that moment. And there will only ever be you, Simon Bryan. You are mine, only mine, and if anyone ever looks at you again, I will string them up by the balls and kill them, slowly and painfully."" Luke to Simon

""I've loved you since the first moment I say you. Little did I realise what a possessive pain in the ass you were going to be. If I'd known... I'd still be here now, even if you are a high maintenance (insert an amazon declared naughty word here)."" He brushed his thumb over Luke's cheek, laughing softly at Luke's look of outrage. ""I will always love you. You fill my head and my heart. There will never be anyone else in my life, Luke Murray. Just you."" Simon to Luke.

No great drama in this story, just a nice acknowledgment of love."

Kindle_Store_5,5,CG,"Aspiring sexual dysfunction Psychologist Bethany Merrick, an investigator in the town of Westlake, Texas, has a hard time finding a woman who is willing to have sex with a man she has met in a bar. It takes a long time for a man to come to terms with his feelings for Bethany. And with a man who has a secret crush on her, Bethany has no idea he is doing anything to make her feel happy. But when the man meets her, she will have to come to terms with what is happening.

The first thing you will notice is the way this book makes you feel. The scenes are real, but the sex scenes are not. Instead, Bethany is thrust into a situation where the man is not willing to give up and she feels no need to be forced to give up.

Kindle_Store_5,3,OR,"Argh, this book is very frustrating. It's sort of like reading a stream of consciousness with, lots of quick random changes of topic. Sort of like giving a character an accent it's sorta interesting, but it got old quickly.

It's also a thriller, and it uses a bunch of cheap tricks to achieve that. Every other page is some new dangerous life or death situation. Despite all the talk of how competent the characters are they are still thrown from one random situation to another, really they are just along for the ride their choices don't seem to matter, the author will dues ex machina as needed to keep people alive and to keep the suspense and urgency going. Also he's really light on the backstory, constantly hinting at it with characters literally saying ""ill explain everything later"" but they never do.

Frustratingly I think the setting of the book is fairly interesting, sort of a shadow run setting, except more post apocalyptic and heavier on the brain hacking/AI side. Unfortunately it being the sort of thriller it is , it doesn't really build a coherent world, you're just left with a bunch of impressions with no predictive power."
Kindle_Store_5,4,OR,"Rebecca Royce adds her voice to this wonderful series with this book. I love returning to the world of the Black Hills Wolves. Each new story brings a new adventure.

 This book gives us the couple of Mags and Clay. When Mags returns to the pack to help her sister, Clay soon follows. She thought she could never have her mate but things soon change for Mags and Clay. I loved this couple and seeing their relationship take shape made for a nice read. The two are great together. Love is something that cannot be denied and the two face this fact and soon fight for it.

Not only do we get to watch a beautiful relationship develop but we also get to see the action and suspense with everyone trying to figure out and stop the killings. It was nice to see the other characters from past books and seeing how everyone interacts with one another.

Kindle_Store_5,3,OR,"At the very beginning of the book, you get this (way too long) introduction by Randi Fang. Since the name of the character and the writer are the same, at first I thought it was the authors introduction, but it seemed like the story, so I read on. And it's a good thing too, because it was the actual story.

Then after page after page of intro, finally came the interview. But before the interview could get started, there was yet more of the unnecessary yakking, where our interviewee sat at the table texting her heart out while Miss Fang ranted and raved about how attractive this vampire was.

Now the story finally gets started, and it was exactly what I had expected, but it was quick. Of course, we know by this point, the relationship will not advance, so it was no hardship when you never find out what happens next, the interview is simply over.
Then some more dribble about how Miss Fang thinks this Vamp-chick is super hot, and we're done.

I liked it, once the story got going, but I am not motivated to read more books because it seemed that there were a lot of wasted pages."
Kindle_Store_5,3,OR,"This is a quick, heated historical read about a young woman being pressured to marry the right man and a man with no title and no fortune who also happens to love her. Its short, sweet and has sexy moments, but there really isn't much more to it than that. Both characters have appeared briefly in the rest of the series and to be honest I didn't really learn much more about them in this book. Paul is quiet and honorable, Georgina feels trapped by the rules imposed on her and does her best to flout them where she can  which contradicts her previous behavior, where shes been much more prim and proper. If you're looking for a quick read with some Regency flair  including a fun historical outing to see Madame Tussaud's waxworks  and like a bit of sensual heat, then this will likely fit the bill. Certain things were resolved a little too easily for my liking, but that might have been thanks to the short length. Overall its a nice read that unites a couple of minor characters from the series.

Kindle_Store_5,2,OR,"genre: paranormal romance
setting: contemporary
format: collection of short stories

The author's book description is so far off as to be false advertising. This is NOT a novel. This is a collection of short stories. I only read the first. If the author doesn't take the time to describe the ""freebie"" stories, I conclude the quality is too low to be worth my time. The first story supports this.

""Bearly Mended"" shows potential. He & she meet when she (a doctor) treats his wounds. What I liked best is the universe, which shows potential. The leading man's personality & behavior was well crafted. The grammar was pretty good, which is above most self published stories.

Alas, the problems are numerous. The plot is fragmented. The doctor's behavior is so unprofessional (what employer would put up with an employee just leaving mid-shift without notice?) and unrealistic (how did this doctor get avoid working in an emergency room as part of her training?) that she would be fired immediately. The lack of police involvement cannot be justified in a society where shifters are known citizens. The transition between chapters can be rough, sometimes feeling like the author accidentally erased a few chapters.

I don't do ARC reviews."
Kindle_Store_5,3,OR,"I liked this book but I didn't love it! I had some issues with Allie. To me a lot of the time she came across as self-centered, snobby and judgmental! I also hated how she would say ""my half brother"" all the time, I get that we need to know that, but if we are to believe she loves and cares for her brother Darius and they are close, by the author always using half brother instead of brother its not believable, they ARE blood, it shouldn't matter that they have different fathers.
I really liked Micah! I didn't think his secrets were all that bad. Although he has money, he is very giving to those he cares about and he gives a lot to charity. For me Micah made the book!
Another big problem for me was, that Allie and Micah NEVER said I LOVE YOU!!! Only at the very end, did Micah say ""this is love"" and all Allie did was smile and nod!! I've never read a book before where the main characters didn't say ""I love you"" at some point in the book. I found this to be very odd!!
I will however read Darius and Taylor's story."
Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"When I was a child, I devoured Isaac Asimov's books -- especially his Robot and Foundation books, which he ended up combining near the end of his life. As I read WJ Davies' Binary Cycle: Disruption, I found myself going back to those days in junior high and high school, lying on my bed and dreaming of a world different than our own, yet similar in many ways.
The world Davies has dreamed up -- Taran -- is on the brink of disaster. A colony of a dying Earth, it has been left to itself since its founding and planetary forces are threatening its very existence. But, that's just the foundation for the story as Davies interweaves characters through various places on the planet as these disruptions are having different effects -- biological, physical, political -- and the characters are all wonderfully crafted to the delight of this reader.
I really found myself identifying with the character Jonathas as he navigated a disaster area in search of his girlfriend and the new-found technology recently implanted into his bloodstream.
The book ends on a doozy of a note and I am really looking forward to the next installment in this series from Davies."

Kindle_Store_5,4,OR,"3.5*
This started out as a slightly depressing story- Atwood's wife cheats on him, his in-laws (mother/father/brother) live with them and take complete advantage of him, his job's in jeopardy. The best thing his wife could have done for him was get him hooked up with the All American Studs crew, where he's finally able to realize what makes him happy.

Trailer Park Abe is a quick read, but there's a lot packed into this short story...I was disgusted by his wife and her family, frustrated with the way they treated him and how he let himself be treated, but glad when he decided enough was enough.

Working for AAS made him open his eyes to who he really is, and that made all the difference for him. Meeting Reece was probably the best thing that could have happened to him, and I am looking forward to more of their story.

***One thing that did bother me a bit, you can definitely tell the author isn't American as there were quite a few words and phrases that didn't make sense for a story that was taking place in the US. It didn't really detract from the story but did throw me for a loop."

Kindle_Store_5,4,OR,"I enjoyed Dead Running very much. It had a great combination of action, romance, and witty dialogue.  There definitely were some obvious plot twists and turns but that just added to the book's charm- it was a fluffier suspense book with plenty of fun occurrences and tame romance to really engage the reader. I liked all the characters too which was a plus.

A couple of things for me that kept it from being a five star:  the ending did not have full closure, so I am assuming that there will have to be a follow-up book(s), otherwise everything is left to the imagination. That was a bummer. Second while the book was fun and I liked all the characters, Cassie was sometimes very immature. Her actions made me cring a few times.  It also annoyed me that for a person with a degree in the fitness and health industry, she did not really know her craft. Kind of made me feel like she was a bit of a dough-head and I did not want to feel that way about her.

Overall a great read if you are in the mood for something not so serious- a fun romantic suspense."
Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"For once, I did know the mystery since the beginning (I'm not usually that good), even if I didn't know who was the culprit. But to me, that wasn't a spoiling of the enjoyment of reading the story, cause there were many points I deeply appreciated, two out of them, the love story and the setting.

The setting was faboulos, and considering I love that Gilded Age atmosphere, and I usually try to visit at least one of those villas each time I'm in the US, I was fascinated like Griff by the architecture, and I believe the description of the lives of who was lucky enough to grew up among those walls was spot on. And the there was Pierce, so handsome and aloof, but only at first glance, cause he is the one initiating the spark between Griff and him, and once fire took place, it's hot. The sex scenes, when happening, were at the same time erotic but classy, perfectly in character with the protagonists, and again, the setting.

I often say that, but I have to say it again, once you read a novel by Josh Lanyon you have the best of two worlds, the romance and the mystery/thriller."

There are 4 Alpha male characters, each with their own unique personality, that I found particularly interesting. The story is told from both the POV of a female character and the POV of a male character. The alpha male is a strong, alpha man who has been given the female name after his family's death and is also a military man who has been given the male name. He has had to face his own demons and go through some difficult times, but he does not want to let his feelings for the female lead get in the way of his personal happiness. The main character, Asher, is a recovering alcoholic who is not only struggling to get back into her life but is also having a difficult time adjusting to life in the military.

Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"I love the cover of this book and knew that the content would be just as lovely...and I wasn't wrong.
Fire and Ice by Mary Connealy is a fun read.  I love Bailey Wilde (and it's interesting that this is a Wild at Heart series and Bailey's last name is Wilde!)...hmmm.
Bailey is/has been disguised as a man running a profitable ranch for sometime when Gage Coulter comes to drive her off of her own homestead, the homestead that Bailey she blood and tears for.  There is no way under heaven that Bailey is going to give up her hard earned living and her hard earned homestead.
Well, Gage soon figures out that he is up against a formidable rancher and lo and behold, the rancher is a WOMAN!
Gage has to reclaim some of the five thousand acres that Bailey has in her possession.  So, Gage comes with quite a plan and Bailey, in a moment of weakness, agrees to his plan.
Once again Mary Connealy pens a fantastic and somewhat humorous western.
A fun read for all western fans!  No ""yuckiness"" either. Mary Connealy includes faith and love of God in this great read!

Kindle_Store_5,3,OR,"Sending a shout out to the author-Julie Bailes.  Thank you for the gift of your book.  I told you I'd review and here I am.  Just got done with this book.  What a rollercoaster ride of emotions?!  Ali, the lead female, has endured heartbreaking loss multiple times and yet she endures.  Blake has been her devoted ally for years and is determined to help her heal.  While I enjoyed the book, it seemed a bit hard for me to get into.  I realize all the reasons for how the book is laid out considering the ending... but it seemed to be drawn out and sometimes slow. The ending was a cliff hanger and ended rather unexpectedly.  Still Ms. Bailes is a fine author.  Her story flows, there are no spelling or grammar errors which makes the story easy to follow.  It seemed to take awhile to really get to the heart of the book but once I did, I found myself eagerly following along, cheering for Ali and Blake.  Give Shattered and Shaken a chance.  I'll be looking to add the next parts of this series to my collection."

Kindle_Store_5,5,CG,"Gina McKay has an entirely different set of skills than most people realize.

The first book in the series follows the story of a woman and her dog, who are both in love with each other.  It takes place in a small town.  This is a very short story, but it is a very good one.  I can't wait to see what happens next.

This book is about a young woman who is on a mission with a group of people to help her to find her way back to her family.  She is forced to leave her small town to become a veterinarian and her dog is a complete failure.  Her dog is one of the best I've ever seen and she is a wonderful person.  She has a lot of issues to deal with and she has to find herself.  I really liked this book.  It was well written and had a very well written plot.

Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"Wow! I have to admit this book took me by surprise. I have had a book hangover for a few days since reading it. It's kinda like I'm obsessed by it. It was easy to read and flowed easily. But, the subject matter was a little hard at times, and a little spicy too. I found myself wanting to yell at the hero  and heroine. I guess if you do that, then it's a very compelling book. I felt like I was there along side them every step of the way in their journey.  I went ahead and read the second book because this one left me hanging. I just had to see what happened next in Katie and Keith's lives.(because I feel like family now) I'm very glad I did because it made me appreciate what they went through and how redemption is such a gift of God.
I will be reading the third one as well. This book is the first I've read from her and I really did enjoy it. I don't recommend this book for younger girls. I think I would recommend it to girls going into college as a really good example of what NOT to do."
Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"Enthralling doesn't even begin to cover this book. Ms. Kelly's story-telling and writing style in this book was more than I could have hoped for. The story was exciting, hot, and hilarious. The plot had me staying up into the night to read longer than I should have. The female characters are strong and take no-nonsense from the alpha males in their lives. The snarky, sassy personalities had me laughing and at times cringing at their crazy, yet courageous acts. Willow is incredibly strong and doesn't hold back. This makes for, at times, a hilariously volatile interaction with Mal. Mal is your alpha male with an overprotective personality. Oh yeah they are complete opposites! I'm not sure which characters I loved more though. The secondary characters were almost as involved as the main characters and had me falling in love with them and solidifying my new addiction to this series. I'm now impatiently waiting for Book 2 and my next love match. Nothing better than a promise of more of my new loves being the center of their own books. If you haven't read this book you need to! This author has yet to disappoint me but this is some of her best!"
Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"First read from Emma Hart and it will not be my last. This book was just the pick me up I need after reading a lot of MC books. Mia and her friends were downright hilarious and the running commentary that Mia kept having in her head had me laughing out loud. West and his filthy delicious mouth was the type of alpha male that every woman dreams of. He let's you know what he wants when he wants it and is very confident in his abilities (with good reason).  Mia didn't think for one second that a casual hook-up with West would result into anything but the pleasure that he gave her. West was thinking the same but come to find out neither one could get the other off of their mind. When Mia finds out that she is now working for him she decides that it will be just business, too bad her heart, mind and panties didn't get the memo. When two people who can't keep their hands or mouth off the other and have gave up on relationships do is anyone's guess but if you'll like to see what happens PICK UP THIS BOOK you won't regret it."

Kindle_Store_5,2,OR,"I was given a free copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.

I really wanted to like this book. I thought it was a great premise and that the author was very creative in her world building. This is a book about triplets who are separated from each other at birth. On their 15th birthday their father brings them together and shares that they have a destiny together to save the world from evil.
Rise of the Trinity started out really well and had a great part in the middle, but overall it left me disappointed. There were several grammatical errors and typos. The wrong names in the wrong place, of instead of or, and similar mistakes. I found the timeline to be very confusing. When the book starts the characters are all teenagers. Midway through the book they have their 15th birthday. At times the reader is told in the narrative that years have passed, but the action would not indicate this. It might be helpful to mark the changing of time for the readers so that they are not trying to put the pieces together.
I think this could be a really great book I just think it needs a little polishing"
Kindle_Store_5,3,OR,"*** 3.5 stars ***

 I don't know how I feel about this book. Don't get me wrong it was good - what I read of it anyway. I had to stop reading because for some unknown reason it made me sad. I knew something bad was going to happen. The sense of foreboding was overwhelming and I just couldn't take it. I stopped reading a chapter 17 and skimmed through the rest and of course something bad happened. I wasn't so upset about the kidnapping. I was far more upset about what happened between Juliette and Killian. It was heartbreaking. I literally felt the pain of it and I wasn't even reading the whole thing. However I found myself going back to what I skipped over and reading it. The grand finale at the end wasn't so great. It should have been more elaborate. That epilogue was meh. I was expecting more. It could have been an awesome book if there was more happiness. They were happy times but it didn't feel genuine because it had a looming darkness that overshadowed it. I don't know maybe it's just me. It wasn't bad but it wasn't great either. I hope the next book is better."
Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"You loved me at my Ugliest is the 3rd and final book in Evie Harper's ""You Loved me Series"". All three books can be read as a standalone but are best read in order.

This book is Joey and Alexa's story. The story begins with a lot of background information about both Joey and Alexa when they were children and flips back and forth from past to present. Alexa grew up next door to Joey and was witness to the horrific childhood abuse he endured. As a result they became friends and lovers as their relationship grew. I loved Alexa's character; she is strong, beautiful, brave and totally devoted to Joey. Joey was also amazing and truly loves Alexa but needs to find his own inner peace in order to feel he is worthy of Alexa.

Chloe's publisher, Hank Hammond, argued with several employees that evening and his wife found out that he had TWO mistresses! When he was later found dead there were so many suspects it was going to take the police a long time to find the murderer. Daisy couldn't let her friend, Chloe, be declared guilty so she decided to find out who the real killer was. Detective Stern was handling the case but he wasn't happy about Daisy's interference in the investigation.

I have always liked the Daisy McDare books and the way she solves the crimes. They are well written, light mysteries that are fun to read. Unlike some other reviewers, this wasn't my favourite. I thought it was slow starting with the first 20% or so giving information about Daisy that wasn't necessary. In general, this book wasn't as interesting as the others in this series.

Its love at first sight, so sweet, completely irrational and even more sinful. We can always count on described in detail steaming scenes, and here even though it is very short, there is not lack of them.

I found the mystery interesting but the rest of the story was hard to take. First, the police were far to generous with sharing information with the amateur sleuth, second the sleezy behaviour of the friend left a bad taste in my mouth and was just left with no resolution and third, the murderer wanted to kill Laila, but all he does is tell her to give up her snooping?

I completely fell in love with Leslie, although I had fallen for him before, this book just proved that my love for the funny, quirky guy was well founded and deserved.

Leslie has a tendency to put his foot in his mouth, but it is honestly so heartwarming to read about a character who will say what they feel, and I have been told on many occasions that I need a filter....so I feel as if me and Leslie are one in the same. Although that man can rock the heels so much better than I.

Oliver, has scars - both on the outside and inside. That man wound his way into my heart, and I am so grateful that he did.

I cheered for Leslie and Oliver, I cried when I feared things would not end up the way I had hoped, I laughed - a lot.

Susan Mac Nicol has a way with words, and her Men of London are just another reason I want to jump in a plane and plan a trip.......I want to find these guys and hug them all, and never let go. Thank you Susan for writing such a wonderful book, one that will be read over, and over again."

While the other boys are discovering the charms of the opposite sex, Zac realizes he has it bad for a slightly older neighbor boy, Rory. Zac escapes into his own world of drawings and fantasies.

Art of the Heart is a bittersweet coming of age story. In just a few pages, the author captures the pathos of growing up in a small town knowing you're different than everyone else, and dealing with that first crush which is made tougher by being unrequited.

Dont be fooled by the subject or plot into thinking this is some sappy Young Adult (YA) story. Art of the Heart is a story mature adults will probably relate to more than teens or twenty-somethings. The effects of first love can only really be appreciated from some distance. Theres a maturity to the story that belies the plot line, which is not to say the characters are unbelievable. In fact, they seem quite real. Its just that they are drawn from a perspective one doesnt often see in stories about young people."

Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"Ceony thought that the danger was over. She saved the magician she was apprenticing and put an end to the threat. She didn't expect to be targeted for revenge for what she did. She also didn't expect to have to hide a budding relationship with her mentor from everybody around her.

I have to be very honest, when I first started reading this book, I was trying to figure out why there was a need for sequels. Then it all hit at once and I fell into the story without another thought. It may have a very slow start, but the buildup behind it is amazing!

The narrator was as amazing in this as she was the first book. I really adored her. I'd love to listen to more books by this narrator. The story was good itself, but she enhanced it even more and brought life to all of the characters.

I do recommend this book very strongly. However, I recommend that the reader read the first book before picking this book up. Many references are made to the first book that may cause a reader who didn't read it to be very confused and not as interested in the story as they would be if they read the first."
Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"My oh my oh my. Blue Saffire has done it again. Hmmm, love the alpha males that she brings to life. I think I just found my new boyfriend Wyatt! LOL, but seriously. I love the way she connects the characters of her books.

Wyatt is the oldest son of Joe and Cassidy Black. He has been deemed the heartbreaker, by many and he hates that title. Wyatt is looking for something special he just doesn't know what that special is until he see Nellie. Nellie has come back home to California, but she is also running away from the trouble she left back in Seattle. The trouble is not of her making, but of the crazy ex-boyfriend who didn't know much about Nellie as he thought that she did. When Wyatt first lays eyes on Nellie, he wants to lay not just eyes, but hands, mouth and body. Can Wyatt overcome his ""Heartbreaker"" stigma and win Nellie mind, body and soul? or will this heartbreaker become one of the broken hearted?

This book had me laughing, crying and wanting a Wyatt. I would recommend this book to anyone who love a good alpha male with a heart of gold story. Can't wait to read more of the Brothers Black."
Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"Love Belvin has quickly earned a spot on my list of favorite authors. I can safely say I will read whatever she put out.

I think I might have been frustrated by the series if I read it as it was released, because each of the first books stopped very abruptly. Luckily, I didn't get put onto these books until all four were released.

I also must applaud the author of providing quality length novels. These were no novellas.

As for the actual content and presentation. Literally the only odd thing was the use of random thesaurus words that don't show up with frequency in the English language. I could guess their meanings from context clues, but I did find myself looking up a few definitions in each book.

The characterization of the main and support characters, and the development of the plot was flawless! The character's had enough of a history for them to be real, and they went through the right amount of hardships in moving toward commitment. She beautifully crafted an alpha warrior, while also allowing him to have a certain level of love and adoration of his woman. The way the characters grew to know themselves was wonderful to watch and resonated with the reader.

Well worth the read."

Little did she know he was her professor, and now she cant keep the dirty thoughts or her hands to herself. But what happens when Harper is ready to commit but Jack isnt?

It's a small office and so we are have constant contact with each other and I have found it hard to strike the right balance between friend and boss. Many times I have felt uncomfortable when wanting to address something with one of my employees. This book has been invaluable to me in that it has given me a lot to think about and put into action. I like that there is a timeline so there are different questions to ask myself each day so that I just don't do a 180 in 24 hours. My employees may just walk out on me then!

This book really made me identify to myself why I am the boss, what skills I possess to help this business and to take ownership of that. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to work on their management skills!

Yes, the first ended in a cliffhanger, but you listened to your fan base when you asked how long to wait between releases. People who know me, will tell you how much I despise cliffhangers. So glad you decided to release them close together. As much as I loved the first book, I can tell you without a doubt that I enjoyed this one so much more. Let me list the ways. 1. I received the answers to all of my unanswered questions in the first novel. 2. The player was finally tamed, and holy crap it was awesome. Once again the sex was smokin' hot. And not only that, we also got to see Xander's sweet and vulnerable sides. Love it!
3. Enjoyed the little bit of suspense you threw into the mix. Although, I kind of figured it all out before it was actually revealed, but I was still enthralled until the very end. 4. It ended with and HEA. Bonus points!

Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"I've read a few of the short stories based in the near future where our online lives are run by autos, smart apps designed to make our lives easier. The author creates a plausible and sinister vision of the future which I'd enjoyed. Now all of the stories have been combined into a single book, along with some new stories so I was eager to read through them.

I'll admit that I was tempted to skip through the stories that I'd read previously, but I'm glad that I didn't. The short stories provided different snap shots of the world the author has created and while they were excellwent reads in their own right, they are so much better when re-read with the wider context this book provides.

The overall story is great, the different glimpses tantilise with what is going on before drawing together into a conclusion that both feels logical and satisfies. It's also open to allow further books in the series which I hope is the intent.

As well as providing a good story the author writes well, although in many ways this is a bleak world that he creates it is still full of life and humour. Overall this is a great read that I'm happy to recommend to anyone."
Kindle_Store_5,4,OR,"I admit to being a dog show addict, but this series should capture mystery lovers who wouldn't know a St Bernard from a Pekingese. Harbert explains enough about the ins and outs of the dog world for the reader to understand the plot without burying it in jargon. And the plot has enough suspense to keep the reader glued to all its twists and turns.

Jennifer, the narrator of the first three books, alternates with Sabrina, the teen-age rising star of the dog show world. This is partly because of Sabrina's  closeness in age to the teens and sub-teens showing their dogs in Junior Showmanship competition and also because there is just too much happening for Jennifer to narrate it all believably. Characters, human and canine, from the previous books develop their personalities and the backgrounds continue to be so clearly described that you feel you could walk into them.

The denouement follows smoothly from what has gone before. I have only one criticism of the ending and that relates to the dog show suspense, not the mystery. There is a plot thread left dangling and I, at least, want to know what happened.

I look forward to the next book to satisfy my curiosity as well as provide a good read."

Waking Up

by Kirsten Clare

I am a huge fan of both Hideo and Tessa. They were both so young and had everything going for them in a way that I thought was totally unexpected.

Hideo was a fourteen year old boy who had a crush on Tessa. He was also the older sister of a famous businessman who had a crush on him. He was a good guy and was very involved with the club. Tessa was a very vulnerable girl who had no idea she was in a relationship with anyone but her best friend. She was a shy girl who had a crush on him from the very beginning.

The chemistry between them was amazing. They both had their ups and downs and they both had some ups and downs that made the chemistry between them melt. The chemistry between them was unbelievable. It was not a bad book but I would have liked more of the chemistry between them.

Tessa and Hideo had such a great"

So Chase's old Dom dies and leaves him alone with the Dom's sons who are cruel to Chase. He asks Ty for help and Ty then agrees to take him on after talking with him for awhile.
Then you jump ahead a little bit and see a lot of characters from the Sizzling Miami series which I loved! They slowly build up their relationship together which I thought was perfect and I could really feel the love between these two.
The Dom and Sub relationship this author portrayed was awesome! The whole storyline with the action, angst and the steam just damn so many scenes in this book were so hot!! I thought the way everything round out was perfect. The author grabbed me from the start of this book and I ended up staying up almost all night to finish this book! Then there was the ending which I will admit I teared up while reading it because I thought it was the perfect ending for this couple.
So altogether I really loved this book!
I would definitely recommend this book!

Kindle_Store_5,4,OR,"Another great book of Katie and Tyler's love story. They are finally back together again and living together in California. Trouble finished their European tour and Katie and Tyler talked all the time and skyped every night. Now that they are back together again and more in love, things are going to take work and nothing worth anything will be easy. More secrets are revealed and they both have to live with mistakes they made and things that happened.

Katie hasn't always been Ms. Responsible or Ms. Perfect. She's lived her life and made some mistakes but she's never done anything intentionally to hurt anyone. She has a good heart and she cares about the people in her life. Her love for Tyler is all encompassing and she just wants to make him happy.

Tyler has a really screwed up past and he's had problems for years of trying to get past it all. He's done so many drugs and almost died on many occasions. But his love for Katie makes him want to be clean and have a life with her. He's trying to find a way to work where his problems with his hands don't interfere.

Definitely worth reading and looking forward to more of their story that comes out in January."
Kindle_Store_5,3,OR,"A mysterious letter, a family secret and a sense of wanderlust leads Keelin to leave her life in Boston to travel to a small coastal town in Ireland. It's there where she finds the truth behind her gift and a sense of belonging she's never known before.

This book is rather sweet. But also infuriating at times. The author goes to lengths to show just how highly educated and wonderful Keelin is but she manages to do some fairly stupid things whilst in Ireland.

I liked the mixture of modern day life with the ancient magic which surrounds Keelin and her family. Keelin's romance with the man next door was rather hot with their chemistry being intense but they were a couple I wanted to know more about outside of their sexual compatibility.

Wild Irish Heart is an enjoyable romance story with a gorgeous setting. The characters were a little flat but considering this story was less than two hundred pages, I think there was probably just wasn't enough time to get to know them as much as I would have liked. I probably would continue this series because I found myself liking some of the secondary characters (who's book is next in the series) slightly more than I liked Keelin and her beau."

Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,The chemistry from the get go was unmistakable. Lorelei was stuck in a self imposed rut raising her daughter and Jack was in a self imposed denial because of what his mom did to him. The push and pull was fantastic until the walls came crumbling down. From the beginning Lorelei put Jack in his place only problem was Jack opened his mouth before he thought which hurt her. Jack didn't realize he did because Lorelei was a first for him. As they continued to explore and push each other Jack is thrown into a situation way out of his control factor which helps open his eyes for a little while anyway. He refuses to admit anything until he thinks he might loose her for good. Being a strong independent woman makes her show who is boss. I found it hard to put this down. I wanted to see how Lorelei was going to put Jack on his toes and how Jack was going to stick his foot in his mouth. Not to mention little Hope...you know the old saying out of the mouths of babes....I could not put this book down I absolutely LOVED it and I am hoping we have more books on the other characters especially Garrett and Coco.
Kindle_Store_5,4,OR,"This novella is a very good addition to the Nemesis Unlimited series. Ada has been given an assignment to gather evidence against an aristocratic couple. This is her first real assignment for Nemesis, after helping them previously. She will be posing as a maid which is easy for her because she grew up in service. Nemesis has assigned her a partner for this mission. Ada only knows it is a man, posing as a footman. She only hopes it is not Michael who she worked with last time. Things got rather personal with Michael, and Ada was very hurt that she's never heard from him in the past six months after the mission.

Michael, who also grew up in service, specifically asked for this assignment so he could see Ada again. He is hoping that, in addition to getting the evidence they require, that perhaps things can start again with Ada.

I really liked how this whole novella pretty much took place ""below stairs"" from the servants' point of view. Michael and Ada have to sneak around constantly, even with the other servants, because if anyone suspects anything going on romantically between them, they'll get sacked. That helps build the romantic tension in the story. Recommended for readers who like the full-length Nemesis books."

Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"Peggy Henderson's Blemished Brides series just keeps getting better and better; In His Arms is my favourite by far. Levi and Grace have both had difficult things to deal with in the past which have left them both reluctant to trust or let anyone get close to them. Thrown together in unusual circumstances, this is the story of two people who find their walls breaking down and that trust and love are possible. In my opinion this book contains Peggy's most beautiful writing to date. The characters are realistic and well-drawn as always. Grace is a determined and stubborn person, despite (or maybe because of) the circumstances that have surrounded her life. She also has a softness to her, and I was on her side right from the beginning. Levi is a self-sufficient but thoroughly sweet and gentlemanly man. I was also very much on his side from the beginning! Together they make the perfect couple, and seeing them happy at the end of the book was extremely satisfying. The supporting characters are great (I won't say more as I don't want to give anything away), and, as usual, the natural world, which Peggy describes so well, is very much in evidence. If I could I would give this book more than 5 stars."
Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"You can make plans and decide what your path in life will be.  That is all well and good, but... sometimes life has other plans for you and no matter how stubborn you are about staying in the path you have chosen, you will need to adapt and accept that nothing in life is perfect.  It is out of those imperfections, or deviations if you will, that life presents us with challenges and triumphs we may have otherwise missed.

Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"Another thoroughly captivating, kept-me-up-reading-all-night story by Josh Lanyon. The story being told in Griff's POV really worked for me, I really connected with him, and reveled in experiencing everything through his eyes, and having access to his impressions of everyone he met. Griff and Pierce made for deliciously intriguing main characters, both having their demons and past hurts to deal with, a past Pierce was so reluctant for Griff to open again..but which he eventually benefited from. The author once again gifts readers with a substantive and poignant portrayal of the human heart.

I loved the distinctiveness of all the secondary characters, each of whom had a crystal clear portrayal.  The Long Island setting and mystique was a character in its own right - I love when an author portrays setting so vividly that I feel as if I am a participant within the story and not simply reading it. The mystery held so many possibilities, just when I thought I was sure of one facet, I found myself doubting... excellent maneuvering of plot, with a great twist at the end. I'll be reading this one again - even though I now know the outcome of the mystery... the lovely nuanced writing style of Mr. Lanyon freely lends itself to new discoveries upon re-reading."
Kindle_Store_5,4,OR,"Yes, this is a new writing style for the talented MS EDWARDS.  She has shown more talent than when she wrote as MS NICOLE EDWARDS. And, I didn't know that there ever was that much talent had existed.  Being able to write books that are that good and being that different is phenomenal. We are talking like two completely different people.

The book was great. I'm so excited about this series. And I can't wait for the next book.  This review will have no spoilers as I don't include them.  They can ruin a book if you include them in a review.

The editing was good.
The characterization was more than great.  All the characters had a perfect role they played.  Each of them could have their own unique story.
The storyline was unique and not boring. You are always waiting for the next page.
I gave it a 4.5 stars and then rounded it down. There was one or two chapters that was a little slow. But that was all.

I RECOMMEND THIS BOOK. I URGE YOU TO READ THIS FIRST BOOK OF THE SERIES.  I AM SURE YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED AND YOU WILL WANT TO CONTINUE WITH THE SERIES.
SO, GET THE BOOK AND ENJOY YOURSELF.

HAPPY READING MY BOOK FRIENDS......."

Kindle_Store_5,3,CG,"Normally I probably would have preferred a little more background in the history of the art.

While I appreciated the story, I found it to be a little abrupt. The author kept pushing it to the limits and in some cases, it seemed to drag out for some reason. The first two books in the series were the most emotional, but I felt like I was missing something.

Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"Leigh finally has to face the fact that she does indeed have feelings for Ryan that go deeper than surface lust. But she's still a girl who does her best to stay rooted in reality, and without concrete answers about where Ryan came from, it's difficult for Leigh to let go and fully trust the man who has her heart.

I had the pleasure of reading an early draft of More Than Words. What struck me most is that this conclusion is a delightful mix of the distinct mythology that played out in Unchained Melody and the charming elements of Contemporary Romance that went into Turn The Page. Add in some intensely heated bedroom scenes and seriously swoon-worthy actions by Mr. Weaver, and you've got a conclusion with some bite.

All of the events from the first two books come full circle, but not before Ryan and Leigh go through a roller coaster of emotions and have to confront many truths about his past.

If you're on the hunt for something that feels both paranormal and contemporary, this is a series that somehow manages to feel like both. And S.K. Munt delivers another memorable book hunk that rivals Tristan from her well-known Fairytail Saga. This is the kind of romance that should be accompanied by a folding fan."
Kindle_Store_5,4,OR,"Seven-year-old Eric has always had an active imagination and a fascination with snow and cold weather. Initially, his father Ben doesn't think that his son's talk of a magical kingdom known as Lukana is anything more than a little boy's typical childhood imagination. Ben, himself, prefers the summer, while his late wife Jamie - Eric's mother - loved the winter. Jamie died giving birth to Eric, but her final act in life was to apologize to Ben.

Ben never knew exactly why Jamie apologized to him, although he vowed to himself that as his son grew, Eric would always be loved. Then, one winter day, Eric sculpts a snow owl in the backyard. With such a simple and childish act, Eric unwittingly sets in motion a series of events that cannot possibly be anything but magical. Now Ben faces the terrifying prospect of losing his only child to a wintry spirit...a spirit that just might be the boy's true father.

I must say that I chose this book because I liked the cover. I also enjoy reading fantasy, and was curious to see how the story would eventually pan out. I give this story an A! - It was a quick and engaging read, and I look forward to reading more from Jon Hartling in the future."
Kindle_Store_5,3,OR,"This book is typical of the genre and is filled with angst, smoking hot scenes and complete and utter denial and misunderstandings. It covers all of the bases that fans have come to expect. Two people who are complete opposites find themselves attracted to each other but have a million reasons why they can't be together.

This is the first book in the Lost Boys series and it is safe to say that Devlin is a little lost and a whole lot bad. Sometimes I find myself really getting behind this kind of character but there was something about Devlin that was holding me back. I didn't love him as much as I would have liked and I found that a little disappointing. It is hard to pinpoint what exactly was off but it was definitely something. Perhaps it was some of his questionable moves. I'm not sure. He just didn't seem as sincere in regards to Rena as I would have liked. Rena was also a little on the weak side for my liking as well. Their relationship lacked the depth that I was craving.

Although I did find the characters a tiny bit weak it was still an entertaining and easy book to read. I think there is promise for future instalments of this series."

Kindle_Store_5,4,OR,"Back in 2011 I got a chance to read Because of You by Jessica Scott. This is where you first meet Shane Garrison and Jen St. James. I strongly suggest you read that story first, before jumping into this novella. However, it is just a suggestion. Here's why:

In Anything for You Shane and Jen have been together for sometime. Shane is about to do something and he's afraid to tell Jen what he is about to do. I don't know what the man was thinking when he thought it was a good idea not to tell Jen. Fortunately, he has a good buddy who has talked some sense into him. I know this is very vague, but it's a novella. If I say to much, I might tell the whole story. Plus, a lot of the background is in the first book of the  Coming Home series. Overall, it is a quick read (seriously) in which you get to see Shane and Jen work out there relationship and over come there fears of what could happen. It was enjoyable and it's nice to see Jen and Shane again. So, I actually hope you get to read both stories Because of You and Anything for You. So, I leave you today and I hope it's wonderful."
Kindle_Store_5,3,OR,"Overall, this is a cheesy, predictable, but cute little romance/chick lit.

It's one of those books where the reader can figure out the general plot within a few pages. There are no surprises here! That said, other than the main character's total inability to figure out her flatmate's motives, these are likeable characters (Josh is practically saintly, which stretches suspension of belief to an extreme) and it's a fun, if rather far-fetched, plot.

However, it could so easily have been a good deal better. Romantic comedies, be they in films or books, are generally thoroughly predictable, but there's foreshadowing and then there's LOOK THIS IS WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. A touch more subtlety would not have gone amiss! It is at least fairly short, or the plot would get even more contrived.

On top of that, it needs a good proofread to weed out the careless mistakes. Lots of capitalisation of speech tags, words missing out, misused/typo'd words (were for wear, for example), etc. Generally I don't expect perfection from self-pubbed efforts, but I do expect the writer to take a little more time to fix basic, easily corrected errors like this.

So... reasonably engaging characters, and the book is entertaining enough (with at least one laugh-out-loud moment), but if I'd paid list price for it, I'd feel pretty short-changed."

Kindle_Store_5,4,OR,"I've had my eye on this series ever since I got to read a snippet of the forthcoming first book in the series, Caged Warrior, due out in June of this year, and so I snapped up this novella as soon as I had the chance.

Dark and unapologetically gritty, this story was full of pulse-pounding action, and earthy heat that keeps you begging for more.

I loved that the heroine was a true warrior -- she isn't one of those supposedly ""strong"" heroines who suddenly turns weak and dependent on a hero halfway through the story. Instead, she lives up to her reputation as a fearsome warrior, and gives our hero, Hark, a real run for his money.

While I'm never one for a whirl-wind romance, and I didn't care for the fact that the ending was more of a Happy For Now than a Happily Ever After, there was no denying that the courtship between these two, and the ending of the story simply fit with these two characters and the world that they lived in.

There was also one of, if not the most romantic scenes ever, despite the blood and brutality involved.

A very solid 4/5 Stars.

Kindle_Store_5,4,OR,"Ms. Toon is an amazing story teller.  Whenever I read her books I know I won't be bored.  In fact, I was reading another book but stopped to read this one when an email alerted me that it was now available for purchase.

She did not disappoint.  Don't let the fact that it is a YA book deter you.  It is still a wonderful story that kept me engaged.  I read it in less than 24 hours.

I really enjoyed Jessie's story and her coming to terms with her mother's death and finding out her biological father is a rock star.  I'll never be in that exact situation but it was fun and full of drama but still realistic and down to earth if that makes sense.  It was easy to relate to Jessie.  It was also fun catching up with Meg and Johnny.

I gave this book 4 instead of 5 stars because I do feel that some of situations in the book were a bit mature for younger audiences.  There is drinking, and smoking.  *spoiler alert* The characters don't go further than kissing but I feel that some terms used were a bit mature.  That's probably just me though.

Overall, wonderful story I know I will probably reread."

I did get a little annoyed with the heroine.  I did not feel the hero was needed.  It was a good story and it kept me interested.

Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"Josh Anvil and the Pivotal Weapon by Bruce Arrington is a YA fantasy about the fourteen-year-old Josh and his heroic adventures outwitting the evil alien Raga and saving Earth from invasion.

Joshs human friend Troy accompanies him, along with Anton, a humanoid alien slave from another world. They meet up with more of Antons people, plus a helpful renegade alien, along the way.

This is the second adventure about Josh and his friends, and this time our hero has mind melded with an intelligent power that guides him into rescuing Antons son and a remarkable young woman who can split planets. Our hero pilots an organic spaceship made from a tree. It replicates Joshs favorite meals (fast food tacos and barbeque pizzas) and conjures cool teen clothes (jeans and t-shirts with snappy sayings).

Mixed in with the fun romp, the story examines more serious themes about Joshs loyalty, not only to his close friends, but also to the welfare of Earth. Our hero struggles with the consequences of rash and revengeful actions. The end of the story is a satisfying conclusion to the current set of adventures, and sets the stage for more fun to come in the sequel. For fans of YA fantasy adventures about a teenage boy, this story is a recommended read.

Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"Well, this was just a wonderful book. I've read a few of Kenny Wright's stories now, and really enjoy his light and bouncy style, and the fantastic suspense that just keeps you captivated - and unable to keep from turning to the next chapter time after time.

This is his first full-length novel, and it's a real treat. It is a self-contained sequel to a short-story entitled Rediscovering Danielle, and you don't have to read that at all to enjoy this one - although I'd recommend reading both, the short story nicely sets up the characters and their backstory and is a highly entertaining read in its own right.

Just Watch Me takes Dean and Danielle to exotic Hawaii, where the atmosphere lends itself well to  taking their little marital game of hubby-watching-wife-flirting-in-a-bar a little further, into the saucy realms of actually (gasp!) seeing her with other people. The story is well-paced and explores the whole risk-and-reward dilemma of a married couple very much in love challenging themselves sexually with the tickle of jealousy to fan their passions - it's naughty, it's spicy, it's so hot with scenes that will lodge firmly in the memory, but Kenny Wright plays it just perfectly in teasing out the nervous energy without piling on the pain, and leaving you with a satisfying HEA."
Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"FINALLY! I can't tell you how long I've been waiting for The Alpha King, but I know I've worked my way through a few versions of the Kindle since I first read The First Alpha!

I fell deeply in love with this series way back in 2013, and since then I've checked back every week for news on the sequel. Now it's here I know it was worth the wait! I fell in love with Thomas Smith from the first page, but when I realised who he was - and how he works into the world of the Five Tribes - I fell in love all over again. I don't want to give away the twist, but if you've read The First Alpha you'll be blown away when you... well, you'll know it when you see it :)

As for the romantic element, LOVE IT! I love a ballsy, take no prisoners heroine, and I love how Evelyn deals with the men she encounters in this male-dominated world of 1912. She's more than a match for 'Thomas' (or should I call him... no, no spoilers), and I can't wait to see how they deal with the Ironclaws now they're a team.

Please don't make us wait so long for the next book, K A. I'm already on the edge of my seat!"

James Taylor sold his ranch in Texas, ended a 3 year relationship to a women he did not love and came home to raise his horses.  Mindy MacAllister has made mistakes and paid the price.  She wants to find someone who will love her despite of her past and raise a family.  When the Taylor brothers Aunt Cappy talks her into coming home, she jumps at the chance hoping to see the one Taylor brother that has held her heart since she was a child.  Nothing worth wild is easy in life and the budding relationship between the two characters is a prime example of this.  Aunt Cappy's meddling, the other tarnished saints not so helpful help and the past that does not want to stay in the past make for an entertaining reading experience. James has a big heart and a lot of love to give and is the first tarnished saint that I have read about who has an almost perfect halo.  If he could just learn to say no and make decisions he could probably ascend and become the first Taylor saint."

In reading this book I learned more about helping her than in many years past.
Since it was doctor diagnosed, it should be doctor fixed. Made sense to me. This wonderful book teaches you different.
Kate and I have begun to put to the test a few of the methods described in How To Be Happy. They have produced laughter and activity we were missing out on just a few days ago.
Sadly no doctor ever told her that laughter acts as a tranquilizer and a mood enhancer.
I wish I would have know how to help my best friend years ago. It has been a wonderful experience to see her come out of that deep dark place she has been in, even on medication, for so long. This book has changed both our lives for the better and I could not be happier. Dont think you have to have a sad friend to benefit from this book.

Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"Michael G. Thomas is a well known author when it comes to science fiction novels and it definitely shows. He did really well with the third installment of the Star Crusades: Mercenaries series, ""War of the Exiles"".

I was introduced to the series from a friend of mine that knows I am not a big sci-fi fan but after I read the first book - I just kept going. The book is a great example of a military sci-fi that puts you on a action packed journey full of surprises. The character development is top notch and the book is very well written. I personally fell in love with the character ""Spartan"" the most. The book has a ton of stuff going on including some terrorism which I believe is a way of connecting the reader to a more present state of whats currently going on around us in today's society. When you get into these books you will start noticing the author has a full on fictional universe going on inside his head not just a single story. I would compare it to something along the lines of Game of Thrones but in space with the depth in each series.

Highly recommend the book to anyone who loves sci-fi / military books or just anyone looking for a great read in general."
Kindle_Store_5,3,OR,"This is one of those marriages of convenience, a trope I often like.  The hero is turned off women, resenting his mother and all the shallow, greedy women of the ton she tries to marry him off to.  The heroine is distrustful of men because of having the most horrendous, abusive father you could ever imagine.  A father who's arranging her marriage to an older ship captain and white slaver, who equals or surpasses the father in horrendous behavior.

She runs away from home to escape marriage and he runs away from London, basically for the same reason, except in his case he wasn't really in any desperate situation.

Well, you know what will happen by reading the blurb but not exactly all the particulars, some of which are fun and interesting.  No real unicorn here, of course, but the symbolism plays a part in the story.  There are also some entertaining secondary characters, although nobody is drawn with much dimension.

However, this is not Chater's best work.  I did not like the hero much. Too immature, too erratically friendly and then cold and almost mean to the heroine.  Still, the writing is good.  Chater knows her way around words and sentences, but I have to like the hero in my romance to be completely satisfied."

She faces two big obstacles...Adam is a genius, but socially awkward and she can't tell him she has been hired to help him.  This book is Ms. Livesay's debut with Avon Impulse and I think they have found a promising author.

I definitely enjoyed this book.  It's a sweet story about accepting those we love for who they are and seeing the potential in them.  Chelsea and Adam were a cute couple.  I loved Adam and his inability to lie.  He is a genius with a form of Aspergers that makes him very literal. It was actually kind of refreshing and made him more vulnerable.  Chelsea grew up in poverty and sees her success as a way to prove she is better than her adolescent life. She has some lessons to learn about what is really important.

Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"I absolutely love this new author. I think he has a big future in the world of fantasy. I so much enjoyed the complexity of the plot and the wonderful uniqueness of the world and characters created in all three books of The Trinity Saga I have read so far. The idea of the stone angels, Nemuri, that rule the underworld, their connection to the watch keepers, the three princesses and their guardian knights, the forest made out of memories that light up, the identity of Pandora, it all took me on a wonderful journey where I savored every page. I tend to evaluate fantasy authors on the uniqueness and the beauty of the world they unroll for us,and the intelligence of overall design - Ronnell D.Porter passed with flying colors. I read a lot of fantasy and consider myself picky within the genre; it is difficult for me to find the author who has it all and settle with the book, so I am totally rejoiced with discovering this one.
On the matter of typos: there are a lot, but no more than in an average advanced reader copy. I wish them gone, but I have noticed that the author is donating all the proceeds from the books to the Breast Cancer and Save The Children foundations and professional editors cost a lot."
Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"Ruthie Knox is a new to me author. About Last Night put her on my must buy list. The characters are realistic with flaws for both Cath and Nev that makes your heart ache for them on their journey for their HEA (happily ever after).

Cath comes from a hard life where she regrets choices she made. She doesn't feel worthy of Nev. She puts limitations on their relationship to keep from making the same mistakes. Gradually, the limitations change as Cath changes.

Nev has his own struggles with family and career choice. He goes along with Cath's limitations because he wants to breakdown the walls around her heart. However, for them to find their HEA, Nev also makes changes to merge together the two sides of his character (who he is and who his family wants him to be).

This combination of character struggles and development makes for a great read that had me turning the pages eager to see what would happen next and how they would overcome it all for HEA.

The book is set in England. Ms. Knox did a great job of writing Nev true to his background with English terms and sayings that added to the story and character.

I recommend this book to any reader looking for a great contemporary romance that will tug at your heart and make you smile."

Love was not the only reason to need a second chance at something important. Their encountered began with the previous books of the series. Through their secondary interactions with the other leads made for a pleasurable journey for the two of them to finally make that step to creating a relationship in Forever, OR. Josh had experienced loss, confusion, and the desire to want what was once his. He knew this look when he saw it on the face of Caroline. There was this draw to Caroline that he could not deny. Finally getting that chance to make things more was the opportunity that he was looking for. Josh captivated me back a few book and the sweetness continues on. The sense of humor was on point and charming. He was all the dream qualities one wants in a man strong, sweet, patient, kind, and protective. His knack for baking pies makes him well liked. It also provides a connection for him and Caroline. I found Josh to my favorite Second Shot hero. He has my heart. Caroline was truly a match for him. Thank you Sara. Where are we heading next?

Kindle_Store_5,4,OR,"I read the short story version of this book right after I finished ""The Blood & Bone Trilogy. I don't remember if I left a review but I do know I gave it 3 ***'s. What I do remember was how robbed/cheated I felt because the short story should have been so much  more.

I can't really explain how exited & pleased I was at received an email from the Author saying she changed her mind about Suicide "", the original title and making it into a three part trilogy. Let's just leave it at there may have been some singing, The Happy, Happy, Joy
Joy song & the happy dance might've made a brief appearance.
This third of the new trilogy is excellent!! :)  The author took a mediocre, at best, short story & turns it into an incredible novel!!  She superbly snakes around the existing material and proficiently pours powerful scenes into the narrative that grab your attention and not let it go.  Also, I really like that she is keeping this trilogy in the same universe of "" The Blood & Bones Trabsolutely cake &It means we already have a basic working knowledge of the paranormal place & persons. There's no time wasted in big chunks of world &/or character  building.

I absolutely cannot wait for the next two booka."

Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"I finished Ambassador: Seeing Red, today. I loved this book.

Patty Jansen has done a remarkable world building job, building a complex interplanetary society structured around 'gamra,' with earth and humanity as we mostly know it, sitting on the periphery. Cory Wilson is earth's second ambassador to 'gamra' - but the first ambassador who actually understands the society he's about to be thrust into.

The politics, cultural differences and language differences are complex, but well developed and understandable, and I was easily drawn into the world that she created. At times I felt as hot and bothered and exhausted as Cory, struggling to adapt to the heat of a world far from earth, or as frozen as Thayen, drenched and shivering from experiencing temperatures well below her norm.

The story moved rapidly, and I was drawn in very quickly, and kept tapping the pages of my kindle much longer than I should really have been awake.

I've been reading Science Fiction for a long time. This story is good. It's not simplistic, but neither is it so far out of left field that it has more culture than character. It's a really good tale with enough twists and turns to keep you flicking the pages, and the characters are real and develop from moment to moment. I'm now looking forward to reading the next one. Ambassador 2: Raising Hell."
Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"Best Laid Plans is like no other book I've read before. The story is action packed, raw, gritty and beyond entertaining. There are funny bits, and of course romance. But the best part is the two awesome main characters.

Stylo's writing style is one of my favorites. She captures your attention from the first pages of her books and this one is not different. At the same time, this book is nothing like her others. I felt like I was watching an action movie while reading it. Her attention to details and how well researched everything in her books is doesn't go unnoticed. It makes the experience of reading this book feel much more real.

The story is incredibly well written. The descriptions of the places make you feel as if you're there. The characters are intriguing, and captivating. Marc and Lily are headstrong, brave and they are focused on getting their respective jobs done. These two make quite the dynamic duo. They had me clutching my heart, laughing and swooning.

Not only the main characters are intriguing, the side characters as well. Kingsley, is I have to say, one of my favorite things about his book, and I'm hoping we get a lot more from him.

I highly recommend this book. I can't seriously wait for what's to come from Stylo. Be sure to 1-Click this bad boy!!"

She is an interesting main character and I love reading about her relationship with Christopher. The premise of this installment, as well as the investigation, is equally interesting.

Kindle_Store_5,3,OR,"Archangel Zach is a quick paranormal read that I found to be interesting and enjoyable.  The plot is solid and the writing is strong and descriptive.  The author has created an engaging world where there are human angels on earth with special powers as well as the Archangels from the Angelic Realm.  These are not supposed to mix in a relationship, but you know what happens when something's forbidden...

Zach's character is tormented and has never gotten past losing his love over three hundred years ago.  It is easy to empathize with him, and to understand why he keeps Shasa at arms length.  I did have a difficult time seeing the two of them together, for some reason they just did not click for me...I just didn't feel that spark between them, I'm not sure exactly why.

The story itself moves well, the second half quicker than the first mostly due to the action and drama that is occurring at that point.  I was able to read this in less than a day, and found the story easy to follow even though I haven't read anything else from this series yet.

If you're a fan of angel books, especially when they mix with humans, this is a good story for you.  Recommended for 18+ due to some language and adult sexual scenes."

Kindle_Store_5,4,OR,"It's always fun to find a new author to enjoy!  This second in the BBB series was just as good as the first book.  Both leads were very likeable, the secondary characters were fabulous, and the storyline flowed smoothly with easily solved conflicts.

I'm subtracting a half star, though, because I came across 30+ grammar-type errors.  None of them were significant to the story or the meaning of a sentence, just small things like using the wrong tense, the wrong spelling for sound-alike words, or leaving out or adding in extra words incorrectly.  These errors should have been proof-read out before publishing ... and I'm disappointed they weren't.

I still recommend this story if you enjoy a good storyline with some delicious intimate scenes, a H who's a little, I mean a lot, rough around the edges and a sweet and mature h.  Both are beautiful, inside and out, if a little broken by their life experiences.  Which is a great segue to the beautiful cover ... WOUZA! ... that is a scrumptious match to Evie's description of Daryk.  Love when the cover art actually depicts a physical likeness to the character in the book, even down to the tats. Now I guess it's time to admit that I stopped reading several, ok - lots of, times to 'refresh my memory' LOL!"
Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"This is a beautifully-written book by a highly literate author who has a respect for the written word. No gimmicks, no hype, nothing that's cheap about the all-important subject of coming of age...how refreshing! Reading the chapter titles alone is stimulating, because you get a glimpse of the structure of the book without being told the exact details (which of course, entices you to want to see how the story plays outs).

The realism of the book draws the reader in effortlessly. The journey is epic and dramatic without being formulaic or repetitious. There are many poignant lines throughout the content too, which give the book added depth and insight. I think the following line (from one of the chapters in The Same Moon) describes the book very well: ""Life was no film set, and there was no script."" I particularly enjoyed Chapter Five: The Courtship for its unabashed view on ""the dating game.""

As someone who enjoys culture and travelling, this book was certainly a treat. The strength of books like these is that they remind discerning readers how literature is differentiated from the film medium. While the latter tends to be more impressive in terms of 'visuals', good literature is intimate because it engages the reader through a one-on-one experience. That is one of the things I enjoy the most about reading, which The Same Moon delivers."
Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"Having read and enjoyed Jonathan Moellers The Frostborn series, I was eager to dive into his latest release, Hyperspace Demons.  That eagerness was rewarded by a thoroughly enjoyable, action packed story.

As a novella, the story ramps up to speed quickly.  Moeller does a very good job introducing new elements, like hyperspace and its risks, plus the equipment aboard the spaceship, all in the middle of a steady stream of exploits and conflicts the characters must deal with.

Everything comes together in a nice package.  The action is well done and kept me furiously turning pages.  But wait, theres more.

Mixed in with hyperspace and spaceships is the interesting concept of hyperspace microbes that can possess a human mind, driving the person insane.  These microbes are kept out of the spaceship by a special shield, so there shouldnt be any problems, right?

Thats where the plot pulls off some unexpected twists and turns, making for a fun read.  Moeller keeps up the pace all the way to the end.  Amazingly, for a novella there is much more that could be said, but I fear explaining anymore will reveal too much.

Too often, shorter stories leave me feeling unsatisfied.  But not Hyperspace Demons.  Interesting story.  Well told with plenty of action and a surprise or two thrown in.  Good job Jonathan Moeller."

Kindle_Store_5,4,OR,"*I was given a copy of this book as a gift from Stephanie's Book Reports in exchange for an honest review.

4 stars for Chicago-a shot to the heart changes everything by AJ Harmon.  If you are looking for a sweet, wholesome romance, this is the book for you!

When southern gentleman, Alex Beaumont, meets the tough yet sweet Mia from Chicago, they don't really think they would have anything in common. However, after having dinner one night, they each discover that they are quite attracted to one another.  They are each in their 30's, and shockingly, neither one of them has ever been in a serious relationship.  To say that they both need to experience that unconditional love and support in their lives would be a huge understatement.  It will take sacrifices on both sides, but if they are willing to take some risks, they might just find what has been missing in each of their lives.

AJ Harmon is an excellent wordsmith who brings both her characters and the places she writes about to life through her descriptive details.  I honestly felt like I was right there in the middle of the story alongside the characters experiencing their ups and downs with them.  I really look forward to reading more from this author!  This is a book that I would 100% recommend!"
Kindle_Store_5,4,OR,"I enjoyed this story. Hud and Mack are great! It is the third book in the series but can be read by itself (or first) without any problem whatsoever. It's a little sweeter than the other two. The sex is still explicit and fairly frequent but just the overall tone was sweeter for me, in a good way, than the other two. Mack and Hud still have some sarcasm that go back and forth but Hud is just such a sweet guy. Hud has been playing football for 10 years and so is more mature and is ready for something else in his personal life. I loved Hud and Macks interactions together and the building of their relationship. It was genuine and believable for me. Nothing was rushed or forced. I was able to just dive in and stay there until I reached the end. In this book, Hud's football has reached the playoffs and so they are dealing with their relationship, who they are to the team, and the extra pressure from wanting to win the championship. I loved how the football and romance were mixed together. It was a great blend and I felt like I got enough of both, rather than feeling like I was missing something somewhere. I really enjoyed the characters and this story.

It centers on the Weathers family and JD (Justice) in particular. He has 2 teenaged boys, twins, Briggs and Dawson. He's a widower and carries a lot of guilt and anger. When his wife died he was having a fling with a woman who really got to him. Then he found out that his wife took her life, not because of him but because of her own nature. That's a whole other ball of wax. Anyway his father agrees to be interviewed by the star of a show that showcases western lifestyles, because the original story was about his family as a kid and what had become of them. That led to Jason, JD's father.well turns out that the woman doing the interviews is the woman he had that weekend with, that he can't seem to forget. Needless to say the story gets ever so much more interesting when she hits town. OMG, this book has it all- action, kidnapping, romance, an angel and so much more. I couldn't stop reading it.

Logan was the one night stand.

Now a twist if fate has them meet up again in somewhat secret circumstances.
Cass is Logans boss but she has no clue about his secret that could change everything.

This book started off at a steady pace, then it slowed down in the middle and hit it's stride again in the last 3rd.

Cass and Logan are both head strong and career driven. They have different experiences in life and this shows in each interaction they have. Because of the complexity of their situation there are a lot of undercurrents in their conversations, but only one of them is aware of it.

The author has done a good job showing the different sides to her characters personalities. The chemistry between Logan and Cass never diminishes and the love they have for their daughter despite the intricacies they face shines through and comes above everything else.

I enjoyed this story. The characters and the storyline is consistent and interesting and I liked the dynamics of the other relationships each Cass and Logan have with others such as Logan's grandmother and Cass's friend Patricia. Those relationships added another layer and also a bit of lightness to the storyline.

This is a great holiday read and worth one clicking if you like a good romance!

Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"What a delightful short story this is! Just what I needed - a feel good, romantic, Christmas story.

The author has written something reminiscent of the film ""You've Got Mail"". A shop, The Gingerbread Cafe, has been in a small town for years, and has been an extremely successful business. Then someone else comes in and opens up something similar right across the road (as opposed to 'just around the corner' in the film.)

This starts a battle between the 2 proprietors to gain business from the townsfolk.

Who will win? Will it be the reliable young woman, Lily, who has been a constant in the lives of her customers for years? Or will it be the young interloper, Damon, who triumphs due to his good looks and apparently irresistible charm?

The author has written a lovely novella, with just the right tone and information, to make this a great story.

The character of CeeCee, Lily's partner in crime in the cafe, is a great one! She is such a sassy woman.

My only gripe is that the story wasn't longer! I would love to know more about Lily and the cafe, CeeCee and her family, and the heartache Lily went through a few years before. Perhaps a prequel in the making? Hint hint Ms Raisin?

All in all a great short read which left me with a huge smile on my face when I finished it."
Kindle_Store_5,3,OR,"This book was raw with emotion from page 1 and starts from after that awful day that changed Diana from the carefree person she was to a person who struggles daily with demons.  You can not help but to feel for Diana, wishing that she would get better.  Gideon was an amazing character even with all of his own demons he fought the hardest for Diana.

We follow Diana on her struggle to get past the fact that she was raped.  She always believed that if anything bad was about to happen that the hero would swoop in and save you.  She had a hero with her, Gideon, did what he could to save her but on that day it was not enough in the physical sense.

As Diana fights to become a person again, Gideon is there every step of the way.  Even though there are more steps back than forward it seems.  He is also trying to deal with the fact that he was unable to save her.  Although his words to her that day did save a small piece of herself, she just needs to find the rest of the pieces to be whole again.

Gideon and Dianas relationship continues to grow, helps both of them heal with the aftermath of that day.  In the end they both were each others saviors."

Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"Well--appears Fiona Gavelle is up to her legal antics again.  And her writer, Una Tiers, is up to her tricks again, delivering yet another page-turner with ""Not Safe for the Bank(er)"".

Ms Tiers calls it a short story.  I would bicker with that classification and call it, rather, a novella, or, a short novel.  It provides all the satisfaction one receives from a work that is longer than a short story, in that allows for a fuller development of character, and a plot that can be more convoluted with considerably more back story.

Fiona Gavelle was introduced in ""Judge vs. Nuts"" as a newbie attorney solving a murder mystery while stumbling and tripping her way through a legal system that doesn't favor the still innocent and idealistic attorney in her dealings with the ""good ol' boys"" of the bar.

In this book, we get the feeling that Fiona, thank goodness, still hasn't lost her innocence and idealism while doing the leg work for her client-by-default, Mr. Fives.  (You'll have to read it to find out just how he fell in her lap--but it's an enjoyable challenge).

Between the first book and this one there is a perceptible growth and maturity in the character of Fiona Gavelle.  But it is refreshing to rediscover that the revolving door still can slap her in the butt.

Kindle_Store_5,4,OR,"Nobody's Fault was very well written and the author uses descriptions and dialogue with expertise and care. The story itself was told well and the loose ends tied together nicely in the end. The author wove multiple points of view from different perspectives about the same incidents and gave us a clear picture of what each character felt and saw and why. Despite all that, I still came away from Nobody's Fault feeling sad and more than a little ticked off. The title is wrong... it was clearly the husband/father's fault. ALL OF IT WAS - any man that walks away from his marriage and children to live with another woman so he can be ""fulfilled"" with ""true love"" is  a sleazeball. When those kids are grown and gone you can find your own freedom and a new life if that's what you need to. But to walk away from your wife, leave your children to live in a single parent home for your own emotional needs? Selfish beyond description. As for the feelings of his new love, the other woman? I had no sympathy for her in any shape or form - so she fell in love, so what? She knew he was married and she trespassed anyway. None the less, I will read other work by this author on a different subject matter, she definately knows how to tell a story."
Kindle_Store_5,4,OR,"Television reporter Jessica Rowan is covering the San Antonio Generals bachelor auction and is livid after her friend, Charlene Simmons, bids for her to win a date with NHL winger, Ryder Carrigan. The last thing alternate captain, Ryder Carrigan, wants to do is participate in a bachelor auction.  However, when the two meet they might have more in common than they would have expected.  This contemporary sports romance is suitable for new adult and adult audiences.

I like Ryder.  He is serious about hockey to a fault.  I appreciate after Ryder was called out by one of his teammates, he realizes that he needs to achieve more balance in his life.  This is a valuable life lesson that can benefit everyone.  I felt bad that Jessica was blindsided at the auction, but I love that her friend bid on Ryder for her.  They have some obstacles to overcome that make the story interesting. The two have great chemistry and make an excellent couple.

At ninety-seven pages, this story is a fast and captivating read that I finished in one sitting.  I enjoyed the charity scene in the beginning and thought that was a clever way for the characters to get together.  Chasing the Prize is a fun story and entertaining read.  Im looking forward to Casey and Charlenes story next in Book six, Making an Impact."

Kindle_Store_5,4,OR,"Well, this one was very short. To the point I was in no way ready for it to end. I just wanted it to keep going, to see what happened to Emily & Michael, because dayam is the reader left hanging at the end.

If this novella (or short, I guess) is a ploy to get readers to need to read on in the series, then congratulations, because the author has succeeded. This is definitely a great introduction to some of the character's in Kemmerer's Elemental world. I liked the two main character's a LOT. The writing has an easy simplicity to it that helps with the cadence of reading. It's full of conflict-romance, too, but without being overly mushy, which can sometimes happen in YA.

Though I'm left with quite a lot of questions: how their `powers' work because that isn't fully explained; the why and wherefore of it all isn't in here; I'm left unsure whether or not regular humans exist around these `special' folk, or of the hierarchical structure of it all and why certain families are expected to obey the requests of others/or stick to agreements made with them; there is evidently some kind of societal ladder and which rungs people belong on is obviously an important part of the world created here ...

So, yeah ... lots of questions. All of which I want answered. So I shall most definitely be reading on."

Okay in one word is WOW. This is the first I have read from Mary Smith and have to say this is not your usual sports romance book. What got me about this book that made it so easy to love was its characters. I loved that you have a person like Meadow who seems like she is at the top of the romance world she is just like all of us waiting for her Prince Charming. The storyline pulled me in and though it is the first in a series I am already loving it for there was so much more between Meadow and Kyson. The cute way they completed each other and easy way there were towards each other is what makes its characters so memorable. Kysons attitude about a cover model was genuine to the point of making him think of Fabio was hillarious. Meadow now is a woman I loved right away for she reminded me of me with insecurities, fear yet still with hope her one love will appear. Mary Smith just wowed me since this is the first I have read from will definitely keep up with her work. Get this book you won`t be disappointed from the camaraderie between its characters, the love between Meadow and Kyson even his teammaters were awesome. Can`t wait for Book 2 in this series."

Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"How do I describe Focus On Me? Specifically all the feels Riley and Colin gave me?

I have to start by thanking Megan Erickson, again, for telling their story. What a beautiful, emotional story it was. I wanted to give Riley all the hugs in the world.

Much like the previous book (Trust the Focus), Focus On Me has it all  sweet, tender moments; super sexy ones; a few laughs, and a lot of heartache, but it's worth it in the end. Riley goes through hell, but he survives it, with Colin by his side.

I loved that Erickson didn't try to sugar coat anything. Riley had problems with depression, and even with all the love, f*&ks, and hugs from Colin, the depression wasn't going to magically disappear. Some authors, I'm sorry to say, seem to think love instantly cures all. No, it doesn't, but love can help a person to get through the tough parts, and there's no doubt that Colin was able to help Riley with that.

Once again, my Kindle copy is full of highlights. I look forward to whatever Erickson has for us next  but, please, can you go a little easier on my heart next time? (pause) Who am I kidding, that's why I love this series so much. Keep the emotions coming!

Kindle_Store_5,3,OR,"So this is a series novel....not a big fan of those. Since this book is the start of the series, you would think that the author would have taken her time setting the story up. When the H and h meet for the first time the chemistry is instantaneous. I'm okay with because sometimes in life you meet a person and that can happen. HOWEVER, to have these two meet have sex and then decide they are in love? I'm calling straight BS on that. And what man wants to dive head first into some woman's drama because she's so beautiful and he just has to have her in his life?  And here we go once again with the black woman always having green eyes ,hazel eyes, light brown eyes,etc. Why not just beautiful brown eyes? I'm being petty sorry. Anyway the story although good moves along way too fast for me. They meet..she introduces him to her drama...he protects...they have sex...her life gets threatened again...there's a big dramatic scene with the villain H saves the day... this time they have unprotected sex...then proposes like a week later or three months later...either way. Too soon. I like it when a relationship gets to marinate the characters get to know each other the chemistry and suspense build up so that we can genuinely be excited when the two main characters come together...none of that happened here."

Kindle_Store_5,4,OR,"This was a good plot and I really enjoyed the beginning of the book as the plot began to unfold. A young 24year old girl, her mother has died leaving her to bring up her younger brother and sister. She finally begins her dreams of studying which will hopefully lead to fulfilment of dreams in the business world when she has an on and off attraction to her university professor.

It seems the young lady makes lots of assumptions along the way and it is a little difficult to understand how she comes to fall in love with the professor considering she spends so much time full of unwarranted anger with him. He on the other hand is like a typical male, thinking he is being considerate and all the time pushing all the wrong buttons. Except the right buttons that lead to an apparent pregnancy.

I shan't ruin the rest of the story. The book is well written, I think it would be nice if the heroin role was not filled with so much anger and assumptions, which leads the reader to feel there is a lot of 'love' that seems to be missing from this love story, however somehow it finds its natural ending. I would encourage the writer to write more as her style of writing is definitely very good and I did enjoy the opportunity to read this book. I would read her work again!"

Ramsey has lost his family to a horrible accident and wishes he would have died with them.  Vessa has just found out her husband not only cheated again, but has been doing it since they got married and now he has some young woman pregnant.  After losing her temper for the last time, she withdrawals their money from the bank and moves it to another bank before heading to her aunt's house.  On the way she encounters a tractor trailer on its side and a collision follows.  When Ramsey gets called to the accident that mirrors the one that took his family he isn't sure he can handle it!  Enjoy as fate steps in to help these two move on.

Favorite passages:
 - She told me that this life on earth was just a test for us to go to heaven. She said that the true at heart die young because they don't need to live the trial like others.
 - This trip was about being able to forgive myself.
 - With you by my side, each day hurts less than the one before it."

Returning home after breaking away from an abusive relationship, the heartache is not over. The patriarch of the family has been murdered and the family is reeling from the loss and the continuing threat to their business and their lives. Jared Corbit is her sister Lexis boyfriend and she wished she felt brotherly thoughts towards to him. What was she going to do?

Told from Savannahs point of view, her emotional turmoil feels so real. There seems to be one punch after another to herself and those around her and the anguish and she feels cannot be hidden. The author knows just the right thing to say to convey the mood, the feelings of uncertainty, pain and love. And there is a lot of love in this story despite tackling the serious issues. Abuse and its ripple effect, abandonment and its life-long consequences are at the center of Savannahs struggle as she tries to deal with her family and the situation she finds herself in now. Jared is more than she feels she deserves and the roller coaster of events that happen don't ease that feeling. Surprising twists and still a lot of uncertainty has me eagerly looking for the second part of this two-book storyline."

Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"Loved it!!!

Chantal Fernando's incredible writing combined action packed scenes and a healthy dose of freaking HOT characters and their kick ass love interests has become a knockout favourite of myself and many, and I for one cannot wait for Vinnie's story (Wolf's Mate) out in August.

Talon is an interesting character that has all the bad assery of an MC President of the Wild Men MC with the sweetness of a Wind Dragon MC Hottie. I liked that he wasn't the biggest manwhore of the bunch. I loved watching him get through his feelings for Tia.

Tia is freaking hilarious, she says it like it is no lies no games. Being a single mum she has her fair share of problems and having Talon come in when life gets harder is a bonus plus for her.

As a couple they rock the pages and bring about a different flavour to the series as a whole. Alliances will have to be upheld for this couple to flourish.

The sexy scenes are sweet and spicy.

Overall I LOVED IT!!!!!! and I cannot WAIT for Wolf's Mate!!!! Mine is already pre-ordered and awaiting publication!!!! This series gets better and better with each instalment and I love how there is an opening for more Wind Dragon MC and Wild Men MC Hotties to get their HEA's. I also love how all the past characters (YES I MEAN YOU SIN!!!! Sigh I love him) interact with all future story's."
Kindle_Store_5,2,OR,"I read this book all of the way through. He explains a lot of things about quantum physics and other related subjects thoroughly. In fact, it was the most concise explanation for the new scientific discoveries that I have read in one book. But where the author goes wrong, in my opinion, is when he acts as though the Law of Attraction and its related theories work to make you wealthy. He says that all you have to do is have positive thinking and you will attract wealth and other great things into your life. The reason why I have singled out wealth is because he does. He believes that you can become a millionaire and even a billionaire if you use the Law of Attraction correctly.

After talking and talking about his concepts I jumped ahead to the author's story. I wanted to see what the Law of Attraction had brought into his life. He said he was doing well with his software company but he lost everything. Immediately after losing everything he wrote this book. I had to laugh! What better proof that the author didn't know what he was talking about can be inferred by his situation? Naturally, if his concepts worked he would be a successful billionaire by now! If you want to read about the recent revelations about quantum physics this is an excellent book to read. Other than that, at least it was free."

Kindle_Store_5,3,OR,"First of all if you are looking for a clean recency novel, pass this one up. 2nd although I really liked the plot, it was lost in the morass of passionate kissing and longing for one another that began about half way through. Now none of this was explicit at this point, just distracting talk of passion and desires. But it was constant on and off between the plot, so the desire and passion overtook the nice laid out plot already in place. 3rd at the end not too surprising the hero and heroine could not wait to have sex, before they got married, and they did this in the hero's house with his mother and sister there. He said his mother would be happy to see her in the morning at breakfast...  REALLY! This is regency era, no mom is happy to wake up and find out your son had his girlfriend come over in the middle of the night to sleep with him and then have breakfast with the family. BTW, before sleeping together he did propose at least. I can't tell you exactly how explicit the love scene was, as I glanced at it only enough to skip the pages to the ending. I was disappointed.
The plot really had a lot of potential, the story would have been better had it focused on the plot and kept the romance clean and simple. Less is usually more."
Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"This was one of the best books I have read this year. Not only is I Let You Go a fast paced physiological thriller it's also a intimate portrail of tragedy, loss, survival, and emotional undoing. Jenna is a young woman struggling to survive after a very traumatic accident. Im exhausted but I don't dare close my eyes. When I sleep Im assaulted by the sights and sounds of the accident; by the knowledge that had I been just a few minutes earlier, it would never have happened Jenna feels responsible for the tragedy and won't allow herself to find joy in anything as she feels she doesn't deserve it. She moves to a small town in Welsh to try and put her life back together. While there she is withdrawn from everyone and everything. Eventually she finds a small amount of happiness in taking photographs. About half way through the book their is a major twist that I for one did not see coming. The author portrays Jenna in such a way that you actually feel like you are in the book with her. The book is a devastatingly real look at how tremendous tragedy and guilt can affect every aspect of ones life to the point it can be debilitating. I could say more but I don't want to give anything away. This story is so much more than a physiological thriller and I recommend everyone read it."

I could clearly picture everything in the story happening to someone and them going through all these motions and reading this story made it seem so real for me that for quite a few moments I would forget that it was just a story and it didn't happen in real life. This author has a way with words that get you to feel what the characters feel and are going through. It makes it seem so real that you just get lost in the book and suffer and rejoice with the characters in the book. That to me makes for a very good book and that is exactly what this book was. It was a very good book, even through its dark moments and because of its dark and raw moments in time"
Kindle_Store_5,3,OR,"3.5 Short review. It took a couple of chapters before I really got into and started to enjoy the story. Juno is living a dull life that is until the ghost of her mother shows up and starts to liven her life up which takes Juno down the path of reevaluating her life and wondering is she really living or has she been playing it safe this entire time. **Spoilers** There were so many times I wanted to shake some sense into Juno and point out all things she was ignoring about her life, like 1) being that her and her fiance Evan and her are better off as friends than a couple, 2) that her ""best friend"" is in love with Evan and that's why she never takes her side whenever they discuss what's going on in her relationship with him. 3) That her so call friend/co-worker is desperately trying to ride her back up the ladder instead of climbing up it himself, 4) that she doesn't want to climb up the ladder because she doesn't like her job, 5) that her and her neighbor from across the hall have sizzling sexual chemistry that you can start a fire with unlike her dull and routine relationship with Evan. *End of spoilers* Good book just wish it had more ghost interaction between her and her mother, would love a second book of Juno meeting Ryder's family and her seeing more ghosts."

I guess it's just that the author didn't write them as well as the first two. I think it's because of the lack of emotional depth and the ending that I felt the ending was a bit rushed.

"". . . am I a unique and beautiful snowflake all my own?""

Holy crap John Cassian is one dark, twisted amazing author!! When I read his first book Killing Matt Cooper I was a bit unsure at first, but by the end I was floored. After finishing book two I am speechless absolutely speechless. This is an amazing book and Mr. Cassian is a gifted author. I look forward to reading more of his works.

""Evolution was trying to stamp me out because I liked to swim in the black pool of my own darkness.""

An FBI agent in love with the serial killer she is assigned to capture, it's almost laughable but John Cassian makes it believable. We learn so much about the main character in this book and what attracted Kathleen to him ""There was something...pure about you. Something juvenile, but pure and single-minded and real. You seemed like such a normal guy, such a hard-working, misunderstood everyman, but with this...dark underbelly."" This book is full of OMG, WTF,  I did NOT see that coming and NO! moments that I stayed up all night just to finish it. All I can say now is Mr. Cassian HURRY UP and release Killing Miss Underwood!

Kindle_Store_5,4,OR,"I have read several of the stories in this series and this one is probably the most hilarious. In this series men can get pregnant. It's actually the way they know that the other man is their true mate. And all have to get over some obstacles to reach their HEA.

Bobby decides that he has to get away from his family. After having seen his brother be awfully abused by their own father and knowing that his fate would be similar when his true nature was revealed, he knows he must seek out. Stupidly enough he starts his get away journey on a very cold night. Poorly dressed he is fortunate to meet Nick and his two friends who are driving aimlessly around. They deliver him at the ranch where his brother Isaac is living with his mate.
Bobby meets his own mate there, but he does not want to give in, not to begin with anyway. It takes some effort from Shott and help from among others Shott's grandfather before the stubborn Bobby realizes where his future lies.

There are some quite distinct hints as to who Nick actually is and some magic wielded to underline that. There is a mentioning of a crossroad demon. And the solution as to who had sent the killer after Bobby is not easy to accept.

I have the feeling this might be last book of this series, but there is always Mason who still is without a mate."
Kindle_Store_5,4,OR,"I've heard a lot about Alisha Rai but I've never actually read any of her work before PLAY WITH ME. Whoo, now I'm starting to think I should correct that...because this book is hot!

Tatiana and Wyatt were teenage lovers. Then they had a bad split. Now, Tatiana is about to contact Wyatt again for the first time in years because, by striking coincidence, it turns out that her biological brother (with whom she recently met for the first time) has gotten in trouble for stealing from Wyatt's casino and he and his young family can't afford the consequences if Wyatt presses charges. Tatiana is hoping to plead her brother's case.

Typed out like that, it kind of sounds like the set-up to some bad porn. Which, technically, I guess it is. PLAY WITH ME is an erotic short, clocking in at just over 100 pages, and about 85% of those pages consist of sex scenes, or build-ups to sex scenes.

But PLAY WITH ME is a cut above most erotica I've read. The characters are well written, with real flaws and insecurities. Their emotions are conceivably realistic. The dirty talk is good. The scenarios are well written, consensual, erotic, and somewhat inventive. Both the hero and heroine get off, and have open communication with one another about what they want and what their expectations are.

Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"Ahh, Kennedy even for a Dom he really was a sweetie! I'm sure he wouldn't like to be thought of as a sweetie, but his actions says otherwise.

Dar/Mackenzie, she was a strong businesswoman, with an independent mind, she knew what she wanted and was not afraid to go for it. Her visit to the Hub, although not her first was interesting, she definitely got more than she had bargained for.  I loved her group of friends, Bella was a good friend, as was Mackenzie in return.

Kennedy had a strong group of friends too; in Julien, Reece and Grant.  We already know Reece's story and I'm sure Grant and Julien's are going to be Fab.  Although they were together for Reece's bachelor party, they really had Kennedy's back.

As eccentric as Julien is, he helped Kennedy see sense and made him realize he had been a fool.

As did Bella with Mackenzie, I loved the interaction between Mackenzie and her neighbor and his dog, she has a really caring nature.

The sexy scenes were fab, and I needed to fan myself more than once, not to mention other forms of relief :) !

I felt that although the story ended on a very good positive note, it would be great to have seen how they got on with the moratorium they had agreed to.

Looking forward to finding out more about Julien or will it be Grant in the next book.  Love your work Sierra !"
Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"This very enjoyable story takes unusual directions from the start. Our heroine is a young woman of respectable background who has had her life ruined by a wealthy man. She has been banished to a convent. Meanwhile our hero is a man who went to America as a trader but took the losing side in the Civil War and has returned, with only a ship, to take up a family title. He learns that he will relinquish the lands if he does not marry and produce an heir by a certain date, which is only a few months away. This option appears to be impossible until as luck would have it, he meets our heroine who is in an interesting condition.

A somewhat creepy item is that the hero's ship carries the remains of his mother whom he wishes to bury on her family land. Why he could not do that without owning the land is unclear. The wish seemed tossed in to make the hero more altruistic and less land-grabbing. We are reminded of a certain character several times by the heroine pointedly asking what can have become of her or a message she carried. This builds to a suspense finale which again is most unusual in period romances.

Read, enjoy, be surprised. There is lots of fun historical detail such as how inheritance worked and this has to be explained to the hero for our benefit, he having been in America for twenty years."

This was an amazing continuation to the Levi and Nix's story that we begin in Body, Ink and Soul. This book picks up right where that book ended so we don't miss a beat (and if you remember the cliffhanger that book ended on you are going to be really glad the author made it a smooth transition!) this book has a few more difficult moments in it and it helps strengthen the love story. As they say in the book ""you have seen me at my best and now you've seen me at my worst"" and this story is a good example of love truly conquering all! We see all of our favorite characters from book 1 and get caught up on what is going on in their lives. I could see where there might be more books in this series because there are some relationships that beg to be explored!

There are plenty of the same tingles and warm fuzzies that the first book brought about which sometimes doesn't happen in a direct continuation novel but I was pleased to note that the same magic I discovered in book 1 was present and maybe even stronger as we see the next chapter in Levi and Nix's story. I thought this was a absolutely adorable novel! It's a must have along with Body, Ink and Soul on my purchase a print copy list!"

I loved the happily ever after ending.  It ended just how it was supposed to to make my world happy.

I first picked this book up because Entangled started this Bliss line and it was pretty clean as far as romances go.  I don't know what's happened but for me, a lot of the Bliss line books have crossed over and include scenes that are definitely not clean in my opinion.  And yes, I realize this is a very subjective topic.  I'm just giving my opinion on the matter.  In this book there are sexual situations, the outright sex is not described, but things leading up to it are.  If you don't mind that, this might be the book for you.  However, if you are looking for a ""clean"" romance, this is probably not the book for you.  There is also some swearing."

Kindle_Store_5,3,OR,"While the first Dark Screams volume was a wild mixture of stories without a recognizable common theme, this second collection seems better tuned. It presents stories of dark things lurking in completely unobtrusive places. A swimming pool, walls in a house, or even a wardrobe - suddenly they reveal a hidden evil which bereaves them of their inconspiciousness.

The Deep End (Robert McCammon)
Very straightforward and uncomplicated. My only criticism would be the unnecessary 'epilogue'. I guess this one is my favorite. 4 stars.

Interval (Norman Prentiss)
The first part really gave me the creeps because of its realistic subject. Unfortunately, the author added some supernatural element which didn't work out for me, but add confusion to an otherwise great story. 3 stars

If These Walls Could Talk (Shawntelle Madison)
Nice one with an unexpected twist that caught me by surprise and made me shudder. I loved the detail with the fox eye. 4 stars

The Night Hider (Graham Masterton)
Great reference to the author C.S. Lewis, though I would have preferred something more fantastic in the line of his work. The ending was not as climactic as expected and Jerry's sacrifice seemed unnecessary. 4 stars

Whatever (Richard Matheson)
A collection of song lyrics, interview snippets and articles, loosely connected into a story about a rockband. Dragged on and on without getting anywhere. Sorry, this was not my cup of tea. 1 star

The second book picks up exactly where the first leaves off Allison is going through a rough time now that she has lost her job and she believes that Cooper was behind it all along. This book you will really find that you will have a love hate relationship with Cooper while he is absolutely charming and sweeps Allison off of her feet at times he also acts like a complete and total jerk during others, so in other words a complete and total alpha male (sinfully delicious yes please!). This book leaves you will a lot of questions at the end like whether or not this is going to work out for Allison and Cooper. Will he be able to change his ways? Will Allison finally be able to catch a break?

K.B. Winters did such a fantastic job writing this book it was full of drama, suspense, action and some hot and steamy sex scenes the chemistry between Allison and Cooper in this book is so great it just grabs you and makes you feel like you are right there along for the ride with them.

Kindle_Store_5,4,OR,"I really enjoy novels involving angels and demons so this was a given for me, especially considering it was published by Random House Flirt, which is quickly becoming one of my favorite publishing imprints. This novels plot kept me thoroughly engaged with its battle between good and evil. Sophia St. James moves to a small town in Connecticut, never expecting to see Guardian Angels in spirit form. In fact, she is the only one who can.
Sophia was a great character. She was strong and brave and I loved her narration. Michael was the angel. He was moody, protective, and volatile. It was really hard to figure out what he was feeling, but I loved his character nonetheless. He had good intentions. Dante was the Demon Knight who was convinced that the reincarnated soul of his lost lover was in Sophia. He was one of those evil characters you couldn't help but somewhat enjoy because of their passion for whatever they are doing. Regardless, I am definitely Team Michael. This novel had the typical love triangle (good boy, bad boy, and the girl stuck between) but it had a unique spin on it that prevented it from becoming a trope.
Forbidden was a thrilling and thoroughly entertaining novel about an angel, and demon, and the girl who cant figure out who she wants. I cant wait to get my hands on the second book, Awaken, because I am sure that Lori Adams will continue to write a great story."
Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"This was a very captivating and enjoyable novel.  Young takes us back to Old Town and Haymakers for one exciting and emotionally provocative tale.  Her vivid descriptions and down to earth storytelling transported me to Jersey alongside the characters.

Youngs writing style makes you feel like you're sitting beside the characters listening to the story instead of reading it.  This up close and personal approach really drew me in until I couldn't put the book down.  I really, really enjoyed getting to know Harley better.  Weve met her throughout the series but getting up close and personal with her makes it so much more real.  I feel like I understand Harley now.  Seeing what she thinks and learning her history makes her more real, rather than just the catty girl weve come to know.  Getting a glimpse into Jakes mind is also quite revealing.  I may think his rationale is completely skewed but I understand (and like) him so much better now.  The contrast between the way the two main characters see themselves as compared to how they see each other definitely adds to the story.

As a whole, this was a fantastic novel that wrapped up this series nicely.  Im definitely sad to have hit the end of the Wilde brothers saga, but it was a fantastic journey while it lasted.

This scavenger hunt for a priceless work of art, will have you routing for its rescue. Highly recommended read for those who love a thrill seeking romance.
Jane Andrews has been down on her luck. The pay of a pre school teacher isn't that great. Barely able to survive, her late night call came in just the knick of time. Being summoned to England, Jane finds herself inheriting her great-uncle's estate. However, the worth of it lays in the hands of a so called priceless work of art that she is responsible for finding. Her one and only hope to conquer her quest is to trust a stranger....Mr. Ben Hunt!
High standing Englishman and art guru Ben Hunt has dabbled in a variety of unethical and physically deplorable activities. He is a mastermind of the arts; collectables and sexual, he is well schooled in his knowledge. When the beautiful Jane seeks his help, he battles with his conscious for the first time in his life. As they journey to find the ""Cupid,"" Jane has to beware of who see can trust. Will she see through the lies spoken to complete their task? With the cards stacked against them, will they ever succeed?"
Kindle_Store_5,3,OR,"The book description basically tells you everything that you need to know about the plot.

The writing is good, it kept me interested and I constantly found myself laughing at Katy and also thinking what a little idiot she was.  She takes defiance almost to the point of ridiculousness, without regard for her safety - or Cal's.  In fact she's pretty lucky that she doesn't end up raped or killed at more than one point in her life.

I don't really know if you could call this a romance though... there doesn't seem to be a whole lot of romantic feelings between the characters.  Affection and sexual attraction, sure, but it almost seems as though the main reason for their marriage is just that Katy doesn't want to go back home to her mother and step-father.  Not that she has a really good reason for that other than being upset that her father was replaced so quickly by a new man - and forget the fact that her mother probably NEEDED a man to help her run their large ranch (something that Cal points out that makes Katy feel bad for about 2.5 seconds).

But the spankings are well deserved and kinda fun, the plot is fairly enjoyable and there writing is well done.  The best part about the book, in my opinion, are Cal's telegrams to Katy's mother.  Seriously... made me laugh almost every time.  And not because he was being intentionally funny."

Kindle_Store_5,3,OR,"I received The Skeleton Garden from Netgalley, Alibi, and the Chatterbox program in exchange for an honest review.

The Skeleton Garden is the 4th book in a series about a gardener who seems to have bad things, i.e. bodies, turning up around her. And in this book there are actually a few. Pru, the main character is a gardener working with her older brother on the large garden of an English home, when they start digging up the yard to find out why a tree didn't grow, they come across a WWII plane and a skeleton. Not much later in the same hole another body appears and the town is excited to find out who committed the crime or if it was an accident.

This book had a very slow start, I have not read the first books in the series, so I really didn't have enough background about the characters to really feel for them - and even through the book, didn't really feel for them either. So it was hard to read. Yes the book picked up when the bodies started appearing and the investigations started but overall I was not feeling it.

I love a good mystery and this book did provide a few, which was nice, but not having connected with the characters I felt that something was missing for me. But like I said if you read the other books in the series, that may add to the connection with the characters that I did not have."
Kindle_Store_5,2,OR,"Usually i get on an author about not being descriptive enough, this is one of the few that i wish he'd shut up. Here's a quick example.

""There was a flurry of movement in the shadows and the boy darted out quick as a thought. He took three paces at a dead run and stopped, stretched out his arms and breathed deeply of the wonderful air, his chest puffing out like a sparrow's, and he grinned a grin that spread from ear to ear. He stood there with his breath held letting the sun, that ancient and inexorable skygod, still only just begun his day's journey smile its primordial light upon him, warming him.""

That's not even the whole paragraph, but that only three sentences, THREE! I got 4% into this book before i couldn't take anymore. The author seems to feel the need to explain or describe EVERYTHING with excruciating detail.

Some may enjoy this brand of writing, but if the rest of the book is anything like this (no reason to think its not going by other reviews) then i am all too happy that stopped. I gave it 2 stars even though i couldn't bring myself to finish it because, again, some may like it and i'm willing to give it the benefit of the doubt.

I haven't read the sample but i suggest you do, if you cant handle a book reading like i posted above, then i cant recommend this book and you should give it a pass."

Kindle_Store_5,4,OR,"I downloaded a free copy of this book from Story Cartel in exchange for my honest review.

I was surprised by this book. I thought I was going to read about someone bemoaning how bad and horrible love is, but I was pleasantly surprised!

Kelsye Nelson delivers a witty list in ""Five Things You'll Hate About Me"". After reading I realised that it's something most of us do - we make a list of why things won't work out - when contemplating whether or not to give love and new relationships a try. Quick and speedy, but refreshing all the same.

Surprise and Disbelief is the second story. It's also fast-paced, but requires a little more depth of concentration. It's a sort of coming-of-age story - the heroine keeps going back and forth between her first love and different guys before she makes up her mind. It's my least favourite of the stories, probably because I would've liked a little more on the story, and because I kept wondering what was wrong with the heroine.

Girl on a Hot Tin Roof was my favourite: I totally got it! Sometimes, you want to... just be! The story is about a young girl who has become a little more than overwhelmed by the male attention she's receiving from the construction workers across her street.

All in all, not a bad read, but would've preferred the last two stories to have a little more length.

I would recommend this book for persons looking for a light, witty, quick read."
Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"As always, I am SMITTEN with Tessa Dare's characters and the situations they find themselves in. If nothing else, the cakes incident would have sealed the deal for how awesome Rafe was. Yet, there was so much more to this big, lovable rake.

Admittedly, I'm a sucker for couples who have to wade through a shared past before they can come to terms with a future. And Rafe? He certainly had some lingering issues about himself and his likability. It took a while before he was convinced Clio really might want him for who he was.

Then there's Clio. She of the eight year engagement. I have to admit I found her family a little unbearable. Not her whole family. Just Daphne and her husband. I totally get why she put up with her sniping and such, but I spent the majority of their interactions waiting for Clio to snap and tell her off. To be fair, Clio's veneer of politeness was mighty thick and I knew it would take a while for her to find the backbone to step up and deal with Daphne. (Also to be fair, Daphne's sniping worked given what we were told about their mother and that her actions were the ones Daphne learned from.)

Meanwhile, Rafe and Clio together made me smile. His roughness against her polite breeding. His kisses....oh, his kisses. I really, REALLY liked those. Not to mention Clio's cake noises. Because a good cake totally deserves cake noises.

My heart was beating so fast and I had to put the book down a few times, I was so nervous about what was going to happen. This book takes on a serious situation and I thought L.G. Castillo handled it brilliantly. Seeing Cassie deal with what happened was heartbreaking and watching her over come it was empowering. This book had me yelling at both characters and praying that things would finally go right for them. Since I read this on a kindle at 71% I literally had to put the book down and take a moment to recover from what I had read. My heart just couldn't take anymore and the emotions I had, it was overwhelming but I needed to make sure these characters were going to be ok...they needed to be ok!

The Story of Cody and Cassie is heartbreaking and beautiful. I can't tell you enough how this book with so few pages can give you so much and make you feel like you read an entire novel with so many feels, good and bad. This series is amazing, she did a phenomenal job telling this story. This is the last book in the Cody and Cassie story and I loved how everything come to a close. This book/series is AMAZING!!!!!

Serena is such a lovely character! She has a good heart, but she isn't naive or crying her heart out over men. She is a good and loyal friend. She isn't fearless; she has fears that she deal with every single day. She is a good girl, but isn't judgemental regarding others who arent.

Linc is well..a good man / alpha male. He has this Youre mine - No one touches you thing, but he isn't overbearing. He protects with elegance, should I say. Hes quite the gentleman for an alpha male, too.

I have to say that everyone should have one Serena as a friend and definitely a Linc as a man!

Its beautifully written and everything fits perfectly!!

Intensity is a great book and I loved it!

I strongly recommend it!!

However, I would like to say that its the FIRST BOOK!! The story continues to the next book or books.

Personally, I strongly dislike when I don't know this fact before I read the book. I don't have an issue if its a 2 book story or a trilogy. But I do want to know beforehand. Unfortunately, it does not happen.

Jordan the guy that lives next door is furious that someone has moved into his best friends house. Demi and Jordan's first meeting did not go well at all.

But Jordan senses that there's something different about the goth looking girl. As their friendship develops secrets come to light and they understand each other better. They must prepare to protect themselves to survive. This was a very exciting book with lots of sitting on the edge of your seat biting your nail moments.

Kindle_Store_5,3,OR,"As you all know, when Im reviewing a book Im big on storyline, character development and connection not only between the characters, but connecting with the book as well.

As far as sexual chemistry, Sky and Ford had it in spades. Every time they looked at one another they were either undressing each other with their eyes or bumping uglies like Jack rabbits. This book definitely didn't lack in the sex department. You were left with nothing less than pure blissful satisfaction, definitely no problem there.

Though Sky and Ford got off on the wrong foot in the beginning, you were able to see how there could be a connection between them once they started opening up to each other and realized they had quite a bit in common. I felt a bit torn because for me, their connection felt more rushed than natural.

Sadly that is kind of how I felt about Repair Me overall. The storyline was good but too much was happening too fast. Every time I would start to connect with the book and really get into it, another scenario was thrown at me to deal with but there wasn't enough time before the book ended for it to feel natural. Either the book needed to be longer or some of the situations needed to be left out in order for the story to develop naturally and really be able to sink your teeth into the book.

I believe this series has potential and I am curious to see what Jennifer does with book 2"
Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"I'm a huge fan of MC books but am not really that familiar with the world of BDSM so I was determined to read this book with an open mind. From the prolog B. b had me hooked to read the story of Colt and Tuesday. I loved that girls attitude from the get go, I loved the way they met and how their world's literally colieded. Their backstories are masterfully intertwined with their present and just made you want to be part of their journey even more and get to know them and the family that Colt introduces Tuesday to. Colts explanation of family to Tuesday is perfect:

""You were raised believin' family is in your name - that it has something to do with blood. ""
""It has nothing to do with that s*** - that's all accidental b. s - the s*** your born into that you can't f***in' control. ""
""Family, are the people who are there for you, who've got your back, and you know dam good and well, you've got theirs too! You don't just run away from them!""

Tuesday has some knowledge of Colts world but from a twisted dangerous point of view, he introduces her to a safe version of the world of BDSM, that has her wanting more. Along the way you learn how his bond with his brother Kash was formed, you learn how important trust can be and the lengths the brothers will go to, to protect their family. I've loved Colts journey so far and can't wait for his brother Kash' to begin."

Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"This is a sweeping family saga set during the Dublin Easter uprising and the First World War. The Carmodys are a well to do Irish family living a charmed life in Dublin. Tragic events following the 1916 Easter uprising sees the family at odds with each other and forced to move to London.
Young firebrand Danny is supporting the cause of an independent Ireland. This puts him at odds with his brother Patrick who decides to join the Royal navy. Jenny his spoiled sister finds herself penniless and forced to look for work. Her Fiance John, once a promising prospect, is arrested for his involvement in the uprising and imprisoned.
This book is meticulously researched and contains many period details that bring the story alive. The working conditions for the women in the munitions factories and the horrors of the battlefield are a brutal back ground that helped me feel a great deal of compassion for the family.
I especially liked the character of Jenny as she undergoes a complete transformation. She starts of as a spoiled and selfish girl, but through hardship her eyes gradually open and we see her grow into a confident, independent and intelligent young woman. The story ends in 1917 and as this is titled book 1, I hope that Ms Petken is already busy writing the follow up. There are turbulent times ahead for Ireland and Im sure well see Danny involved. I look forwards to reading the follow up as this writer has a very engaging style and her research is solid."

Sheila Benton; has a trust account that says if she embarasses the family name she will loose her money.  The story opens with Sheila and her boyfriend (who by the way is married) doing drugs.  He leaves to discuss divorce settlements with his wife and Sheila just knows that she will not be able to do without the drugs while he is gone. Meanwhile checking the mail she finds a threatening letter.

Lying to her Uncle who monitors her money, gives her $100 ....off to buy her drugs and returning to her apartment she finds a dead body in her living room.  Panic of course sets in as she is in possesion of drugs. so the story takes off.  Shelia doesn't want her Uncle to control her life so looks in the yellow pages for lawyers and finds Steve Winslow, an actor who graduated from law school but had never practiced law.

The story at times is funny, this lawyer who has never even been in a court room in a high profile trial.  Well many twists and turns, then a side story about finding out who is Shelia's father.  Without telling the end of the story and trial, the search for Shelia;s father is unclear ....would I read another book, yes probably."

Then suddenly, they are laying it on the line and he proposes. The excitement is back and it it makes Liz want to find a way to keep it! She wants to be strawberries and whip cream instead of peas and carrots. And they have it, at least for now.

Such an amazingly great story! I have not laughed, and cried so much for a book in a while. I was truly impressed and that is not so simple to do. I found the characters sincere and their quest was for the same thing we all want - to be happy we have found the right someone and have the happy after the buildup.

Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"I first read Ernest Hemingway as a young college student and missed the depth in his simplicity. Reading him again has turned my opinion around. I urge you to read this book. In ""The Old Man and the Sea,"" he shows the story is not in the language per se, but in the complexity found in the subtle reality of life. Of course, ""Old Man,"" is not subtle in the classic sense. What I mean is that Hemingway doesn't labor the book with fantastic descriptions detailing the intricacies of the sea, or of being a fisherman. Instead, he delves into the mind of the old man, shows the fatherly love he has for a young boy, and the quest for his legacy. A quick read, I finished it in three or so hours. I was captured by the smell of the salt and the slippery feel of fish squirming in a net. I felt the thirst of a long night fighting a huge fish, and the burn of a fishing line running through my hands. I missed the young boy's company late on the boat, and also wished he were to help me fish. How Hemingway did do this to me?

As a Midwesterner, I have barely seen the sea, and have never really fished. It is a great book. Read it for the drama, the language, the psychology, the suspense. It is romance in the sense an old western novel is a romance. By all means, read it. I fully recommend ""The Old Man and the Sea"" by Ernest Hemingway. Anthony Trendl

Kindle_Store_5,4,OR,"*This Book Was Given To Me By The Author In Exchange For An Honest Review*

This book may just be the total epitome of geekyness and I don't mean that in a bad way. It is obvious that the writer is completely in love with everything to do with this genre and the book is filled with references galore that the nerd in me reveled in at first although I must confess I preferred the earlier slightly less obvious mentions to the later ones that were quite blatent and at times I found myself lost in the ""What is that reference game"" which took me momentarily away from the focus of the story,

The book itself is split into 3 mini books each a little story within themselves. Personally I loved the first book the best and I wish that the author had carried along in that vein of thought but don't get me wrong the 2nd and 3rd books are good in their own way, they just have a different feel to them.

As the books progress the author moves you from ""almost"" reality, way into the depths of fantasy and he does it well although there are moments that felt a little forced or disjointed for me which is fairly common in newer writers.

Overall I would say if like me you are a fan of Epic Fantasy and would feel right at home in the middle of a comic con convention then this would be a good fit for you.

Kindle_Store_5,3,OR,"Veiled by L. Chapman is a story about losing the one you love and finding someone when you least expect it. Jenny is put through more than one could imagine as she begins to feel her pending nuptials are in danger of panning out. Her fianc, Rich, has become withdrawn in their relationship. Feeling lost and in need of a girls night, she meets a handsome stranger in a bar. Warren turns out to be the spark she was missing in her life.

Much to Jenny's surprise, she finds her husband with another man. He is honest with her and explains the possibility of a health risk. The two are not on speaking terms thanks to this shocking revelation. After tests and full disclosure to Warren, they continue to get closer with their feelings. Knowing her whole world is changing right before her eyes, Jenny decides to move on the best she can and let things take their rightful course.

Veiled ends one happy ending and gives hope to finding a new one. The plot moves quickly as it seems a black cloud is following Jenny everywhere she goes. Her share of bad luck surely must be about to end soon. I was happy to see Mark and Megan were still going strong in their relationship. Baby Lucy is cherished and loved by her little family.

The author never mentuons that in the book but they do talk about all the time in the gym she spends and how proud she is of her body and her beauty. How he touches her taut abs and toned legs and so on. Yes you can be curvy and fit but I didn't get that from this book. I feel like she is a skinny gym rat. The book itself starts out so boring I  had to force myself to keep reading. It picked up a little at the end but the ""twists"" in the story didn't  intrest me and where kind of sick. Only a handful if males can mate and she was kidnapped after concieving from one night. Then she gets passed around to the brother. They expect her to have sex with him, which she does, and have 20 babies. Then with the upheavals all she is is a vessel.

Grace Hart is many things. She is a cousin, a daughter and a fianc. She enjoys her job, is basking in auntie-hood and is eagerly planning to walk down the aisle with a man she adores. What could be the problem? On the surface, nothing, but as Grace shares her past and the often painful memories she has, it is easy to see the serene faade is hiding a lot of pain. Jonathan Waters, her fianc, is loving, supportive and ready to provide the understanding ear or pillar of strength that is needed to help Grace through the painful journey of discovery she is on. He is sexy, dominant and a perfect partner to his strong, yet vulnerable, fianc. The writing style is natural and flows easily.

Ms. Reynolds has always been a go-to of mine when I'm in the mood for an alpha, but Nolan is by far the most possessive, protective, and yes, obsessed, alpha I've ever had the pleasure of meeting and Chloe is absolutely perfect for him.

Usually when I'm reading a novella I have a hard time feeling the connection between the hero and heroine but the connection between Nolan and Chloe was obvious from the first word. Yes, Nolan's an ass, and okay, maybe Chloe is a bit of a doormat, but who cares? It works for them, and it worked for me while I was reading it!

I love the whodunnit aspect of the story, but I love how that's not necessarily the main focus. The main focus totally being the smoking hot sexy times between Nolan and Chloe, of course! But I LOVE how they always end it with ""I Love You""... It adds the perfect amount of sweetness to counter balance the hotness.

My only complaint would be that I wish it were longer. And it would have been great to read from the beginning of their relationship, though even starting after they're already together I didn't really feel that we missed anything... That's just me being selfish and wanting more.

I cannot wait for the rest of this series and I'm really hoping we get to see more of Chloe and Nolan, too!

Twenty years after the massive event happened that claimed the lives of a lot of the other teens in attendance at the part Vivienne appears out of nowhere. Everyone she knew has aged even though she hasn't at all. Vivienne longs for Ray to also return but when he doesnt she dedicates her life to figuring out time travel to hopefully save Ray from whatever event had sucked her into the future.

A Betrayal of Time by Lucia Ashta is a novella length fantasy read that had a great story of lovers ripped apart but would do anything to be together again. The town thought it was an earthquake that had stolen the lives of their children until the day Vivienne appeared again. Once it was known that she wasn't the only one whos body hadnt been recovered she dedicates her life to figuring out what had happened.

While being a short read the author did a wonderful job weaving together the time travel along with letting the readers know enough about the characters to care about their outcome. This is definitely one Id recommend to the fantasy/time travel lovers out there.

Scarlet was even worse. Instead of swallowing her pride, she nearly cost the destruction of her business. Not to mention, when she did swallow her pride, it was for the wrong reason. Sorry, hate to say this, but I didn't care for where it ended. Sure, time passed, but I felt that another book of them growing together versus a little tidbit about six months later, would have been the better choice.

As always with E.L. Todd, the writing isn't bad. It is quick and easy to pull through. Despite my dislike for these characters, I did like her writing enough to finish the book. I also like that Janice made an appearance and that Scarlet did grow a pair for her friend. I still feel Scar could have done something before this book, but I'm glad she did the right thing.

Really, the book wasn't bad, I just didn't care for where it was going where Sean and Scarlet are concerned."

This is a great standalone story and book three in the series.  Book One introduced the concept of two worlds post war, divided by hidden portals. Cascadia is a world without technology or motorized vehicles and it citizens have paranormal abilities the Pacificans covet. For years the Pacifican Army has created crime waves they attribute to the Cascadians, giving them the reason they need for sustaining funding and support to continue their troop numbers.  They also seek out descendents of Cascadians living in Pacifica who have paranormal abilities and force them into the army. Those who refuse are incarcerated.  The more promising of these Talents are sent to a research lab, The Institute.  That is where Vince Crawford has been held for the past ten years, refusing to give up information about a portal he discovered that led him to Cascadia and Zara Kane, the girl he fell in love with.

Zara had just told Vince she was pregnant when he disappeared. Thinking he abandoned her, she is shocked to learn he has been imprisoned the whole time. Fiercely determined to free him, she convinces her brother to help and uses her cloaking Talent to get Vince away from his work detail and to a safe house. But neither of the lovers are the same people they were before Vince was taken. Their resulting story is one of bravery, love and patience in the face of Vince's PTSD and the force of the Pacifican Army intent on recapturing their most valuable prisoner."

Grace Grainger is a journalist and a very good one.  She chooses to spend her time reporting on the lives of those who defend their country, living with them, much like her own tour of duty and is actually ""embedded"" into the team she is with.  Air Force Master Sergeant Josh Travers is a Pararescue Jumper and has done more than his share of tours overseas.  Both of them fantasize about the hot night they had with a stranger several years in the past, and both find themselves very surprised when in the heat of battle, the Pararescuer that comes to save the group Grace is with is the same hottie she got nasty with 3 years ago.

Thrown together in the middle of Afghanistan, the chemistry between these two is undeniably electric, despite the circumstances they find themselves in.  Then, there is the fact that Josh ""hates"" reporters, which presents a different problem.  The danger, drama, and romance in Dangerous Territory will keep you on the edge of your seat, while you fan your face from the heat that isn't even coming from the desert.  I enjoyed this military romantic suspense story, which is something different that I usually don't read, and was a very welcome change that I enjoyed.

Kindle_Store_5,4,CG,"Love, Life and Everything Else (Cora Deleuze's book)

The Clue is a short book that is packed with information and then the beginning of a great story. The story begins with the main characters, Stephanie, and Tori. Stephanie is a teacher in her first year. She is a widow and has been engaged to a man named Henry since her husband died. They live in a small apartment on the edge of town, but all that changes when she finds out about his father's death. The story continues with Stephanie, Tori, Stephanie's best friend, and Stephanie's best friend. Stephanie is a recovering addict and is not sure if she will survive the ordeal of being in the hospital, or if she will be able to find a new life.

This is a good story with lots of information and with good characters. There are a few surprises along the way. I recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a good story that is not predictable. The characters are well developed, the story is well written and the plot is well written. The only thing I would change is that I will be reading more of these stories by this author.I have enjoyed all of the books in this series.  I have read all the books and will continue to do so"

There is a lot of potential here for a romance between a nurse and her baby. I loved the way the story went about this mystery. The romance was believable, but the pregnancy was not as great as the other two. I would like to see more of a storyline between the two of them. I found myself wanting more and was a little disappointed. There were too many spelling and grammar errors and I was a little confused at the end. I would have liked to see more of the story.

Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"This book is - in a word - emotional. It's beautiful and brutal, honest and raw. It's a coming of age story of self-discovery and learning what matters.

Dawn considers herself the outcast of her small beach community. She and her best friend Zeke since childhood, and the two are inseparable. They have an us against the world mentality, especially when it comes to the other kids their ages. Dawn is every teenage girl. She's trying to figure out who she is, who she wants to be, and what she wants out of life.

Shea moves in next door and immediately immerses herself into Dawn and Zekes world. She's different; free. A young girl with worldly knowledge beyond her years. But like a lot of free spirits, there's an underlying current running through them. Shea is an incredible character.

This book is hopeful and heartbreaking. I found myself more than one having to take a deep breath, clutching my e-reader to my chest, praying that what I thought was about to happen really wasn't going to. That's how well Lilliana wrote this story. You don't feel like you're reading a work of fiction, but rather that you're living it with them. Every scenario, every feeling, you are in. You feel right along with them. This isn't a lighthearted book, but that's not to say that there aren't lighthearted moments. And the supporting characters make the book very well rounded.

I can't say enough about this book. It will touch all of your emotions. You will think about Dawn and Shea long after you've read the last word."
Kindle_Store_5,3,OR,"Ryder is still grieving the wife he loved and lost more than 4 years ago, but finds himself drawn to his best friend Tess in deeper ways; they are in love with each other, but don't want to risk ruining their friendship.

Best bits: Both Tess and Ryder had messed up birth parents, though Ryder was adopted into a loving home when he was 10 and Tess is still dealing with the aftermath of life with her crazy mother. Now, they both dedicate themselves to saving lives as EMTs. They're both good people, and both rather hung up on each other, though only Tess admits it to herself, and neither wants to mess up their friendship by being the first to move them towards romance. Definitely two very similar people, and once Ryder can get past his fear of losing someone he loves, they seem golden.

Issues: Plenty of typos and wrong words, as well as formatting errors with paragraph breaks happening where they shouldn't (especially in conversations, where it got really confusing as to who was talking at times) and not where they should. A handful of places where thoughts or memories really need to be set apart by italics. Not a fan of the ""quotes"" from characters that start each chapter (this time on separate pages before the chapters?). They feel forced and unnecessary. Some inconsistencies, like Tess's childhood first being described as constant movement from state to state as her mom switched boyfriends, but always after that she's described as having a hometown in NH that she was desperate to escape from."

Kindle_Store_5,3,OR,"The Three Laws are:

A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.
A robot must obey the orders given to it by human beings, except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.
A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Laws.

Although the author didn't state the Laws in the story she did refer to them.  In my opinion if they could break one, why couldn't they break another.  If so, then why did they need the mechanic.

Dunn is a space engineer that that goes from planet to planet for jobs.  He wakes up from hypersleep to handle his latest job, to fix the communications of a planet from which nothing has been heard for over twenty years.

I enjoyed the clear crisp writing, in the style of the early masters.  Up until the end, when I realized that the laws had been broken even though the author implied that the robots couldn't break the laws.  To be specific, the robots should not have been able to allow harm to come to any of the humans.

In addition, as to the last paragraph there was no foreshadowing or any support for what was happening.

So while I would love to read more by this author, I hope that she will stick to the rules she creates in her universe(s), or explain how/why they were broken or by-passed.

While I didn't like the rule breaking, I did like the story.

I recommend this story."

First Impression: Well-written, engaging, expertly executed, and FUN, a book after my heart. Chloe is a software analyst who works from home and only allows herself to truly experience lifeand sexwhen she goes to comic conventions, dressed in sexy cosplay costumes that give her the carefree confidence she lacks in her day to day life. She likes the role play a lot because she feels brave in the costumes, more in control of herself and her needs. It's at one of the conventions she goes to that she meets Grant Osprey and though they didn't share their real names, they did share a night together. A night Grant would like to repeat, despite the fact that his convention lover turns out to be his friend and business partner's little sister. Oops. I freaking loved this book! It's a quick, fast-paced read that immediately caught my attention and held me captive throughout my reading. Maybe it's the author's easy, seemingly effortless writing style, or maybe it's my own experiences with going to comic conventions and being amazed by all the costumes--a few of which my own niece has designed and worn, but I instantly fell in love with Chloe and Grant's story because I could relate to them on a very real scale. Which made for such a fun and enjoyable read for me. If you love stories of forbidden love with fun, sexy role play between two well-drawn characters who will positively mesmerize you, Playing For Her Heart by Megan Erickson is an excellent read by an extremely talented author."

The chapters seemed to break in random places as if someone just counted every so many pages and placed a chapter there. There wasn't really a concrete story being told. It's written more like a detailed account of someones life. Like watching a real life family live and writing each conversation and event in detail. I actually really liked that about the book but it had no real ending to it. I looked up what the series is about and it seems that this is a lead in for the 2nd book. I don't know if I liked it enough to buy the rest of the series. I did enjoy it and it has a unique group of characters, rather than the young sexy hearth throb the hero is actually an older  widower in his 50's with adult children and the heroine is a widowed woman in her 30's. I feel like this book is still a little on the premature side. I can't put my finger on it but the book felt lacking to me. I didn't fully understand the characters and their thoughts and feelings. I felt a little disconnected from where they were all coming from. Also the romance seemed rushed in the end and went from no love to instantly in love very quickly with no real lead in or gradual build up.

Liz is every bit the warrior she was bred to be while Jack is the perfect seductive vampire. Both on the hunt for a mysterious creature that has been leaving a trail of bodies in it's wake. Working together is not something either of the main characters want. For starters, Liz hates Jack and when her friend discovers a way to increase Liz's power, more than doubling her strength and giving her the tools she needs to defeat whatever it is that is lurking and killing in the shadows of Boston, she is repulsed. But after facing the demon on her own, and taking beating, Liz admits, she needs the help and goes Jack with an interesting proposal. If they have sex, she can absorb his power and become strong enough to kill the demon.

For a short paranormal romance, this book has spice and striking characters. As expected for this type of book, the pace was quick and never dull. However, as I was reading I felt as if this was a second book rather than a first in the series. The world building was a little weak, not much background was given of the hunters or the vampires and there wasn't much of an explanation given for what Absinthe really even is. Though, lack of world building has actually made me want to know more and I have already acquired book two, Bound by the Vampire.

Kindle_Store_5,3,OR,"Whew, this book may be one of the most intense love stories that I have ever read. I enjoy books about the corporate world, especially relationships involving an executive and a lower level employee. In Tracy Wolff's Addicted, CEO Ethan Frost and intern Chloe Girard are madly in love.  Actually, the word madly is an understatement, their love is completely all-consuming, and as a result they are unable to function when they are apart from each other.

After reading the dramatic prologue, I was hooked, at least for a little while. Some of the scenes are repetitive....Chloe running away almost every time she and Ethan have a problem, Ethan waiting for Chloe to come back to him, and Chloe's inability to cope with her past, to name a few. The story is good, what there is of it. A little less sex and a little more plot would have made the book more interesting.

Ethan is a likable character, albeit a bit tortured by his lack of pure common sense. He may be uber smart when it comes to business mergers, but when love is involved, he is downright simple. He does not learn from his mistakes because he makes the same poor choices over and over again. Chloe is an intelligent young woman, however, she is quite immature when it comes to being in a relationship. Chloe's best friend is a real hoot and I would have liked to learn more about her character.

Scorching sex scenes are an integral part of this book and Ms. Wolff does an excellent job of creating passion. Overall, a good read."
Kindle_Store_5,3,OR,"First let me start off and say I hate serial books. Totally hate them. However I did bite at Entwined for two reasons. One, it was free. Second, it was a Tarzan and Jane book. I have always been so intrigued with Tarzan and Jane and I thought there certainly isn't any harm is downloading a freebie from Amazon.

I wasn't disappointed but I also wasn't thrilled either. I would bet if I read this story as a full length novel, I'd have liked it a whole bunch more. One of the reasons I despise serial books is because each book leaves off on a cliffhanger and you are forced to buy the next installment to read on. I really really reallllly hate that. It is such a turn off for me. I'd rather have spent $5 and got the entire book than a grabby grab for a continuous purchases. Oh well, I knew that going in so I shouldn't really complain. Good on the author for letting it been known in the book blurb that it is a serial book before you buy.

The writing was really good. Great descriptions. Easy to follow and even though it was a novella, I got to know the characters pretty fast. Since it is an erotic novella, there are a few great steamy scenes. Of course you have to read further into the series to get the smoking steamy scenes.

Kindle_Store_5,4,OR,"From the very beginning of this series, I knew that Gretchen de la O had given us a gem. What I hadn't expected was the respectful, slow and magical transition from YA to more Adult. You literally feel like you are growing up with Wilson Mooney, our heroine of the series.

In the final installment to the Wilson Mooney Series, we finally get to know what happened in the epic cliffhanger of ""Eighteen At Last."" Wilson and Max are reeling from the last few days. Max, dealing with the death of his father and Wilson with the decisions she has made as a result of hurt feelings and misunderstandings.

The one thing that is hard for me to remember, even though Max is Wilson's teacher, he is still relatively young himself. Two young people dealing with a love so epic, there are bound to be major bumps in the road.

However, the one constant is their unquestionable love for one another. ""Beyond Eighteen"" delivers us the stunning conclusion while adding its own bit of drama for Max and Wilson. Before they an truly move on with their rest of their lives, Max must face what the death of his father means for his future when the conditions of the will come to light. Wilson must likewise finalize things with the death of her grandfather and figure out what the next steps will be with her mother.

I must say this was my favorite of the 3. The first 2 Books set us up for the climatic energy in Book 3. I really liked that all the characters from previous books play a continued part in the ending of this Trilogy. Incredibly imagined, yet believable character. Imagine if you will,  Jack the Ripper returning to modern times as a vampire in Brooklyn, New York! If you cannot make that leap let Brock make it for you and take this journey along with Leo, Kat, Marvin, Vincent, Trinh, Carol and a motley crew of vampires, werewolves, bloodlings and humans good and evil on this amazing adventure. I look forward to reading much more of Brocks work in the future.

Synopsis (from back cover): Jack the Ripper, sadistic madman of old London, once thought long dead, has returned to New York in an effort to quench his thirst for blood and mayhem. When the city's vampire enclave finds itself insufficient to deal with a madman of Jack's caliber, Vincent, the enclave head, enlists Leo Malone to put the maniac down before he reveals the existence of vampires as he throws the city into the throes of chaos and terror. Leo soon finds that Jack is not the only monster with which he must contend. A ghost from his past has also seemingly crawled from its grave and seeks to put an end to him and the rest of his kind."

 5 STAR REVIEW 

Pennie loved to read and that is why she was involved in her monthly book club. She was always comparing those book boyfriends she was reading about. Her social life was missing between her school work and her tight budget there was not much for her to do. But her life would change forever once she finds face to face with Carter, a woman that stop at anything to obtain what she wants. Carter was a business woman and she knew she had to be ruthless in her cut-throat world. When she finds herself with Pennie she knew she wanted to have her, protect her and love her in her own way. However there is a whole lot of issues they will have to face in order for her to be happy with Pennie. Carter and Pennie don't have the conventional relationship, but they know they are good for each other but how far will they are willing to go to achieve their happily ever after?

Well let me tell something this is my first F/F romance and I was surprised how this book had so much to offer. The plot had you sucked in and you will want to read the whole book before you put it down. This book will show you the lengths someone is willing to go for the person they love and no matter how you get there the only thing matters is how you will take it from that point on. I love this book and I will recommend for everyone to read this book. Gifted by author in exchange for an honest review. https://www. facebook."
Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"Dorian Devil is the type of character you want to know more about the further his story develops. In Venice, we are introduces to parts of Dorian that were not provided in the first book Denver. We get to see why he seems like a jerk one moment and a nice guy the next. The poor guy was being gunned for by his own family. Who wouldn't be a little emotionally scarred from that? On top of that, in this second installment of The Enchanter, the hunters are attempting to wipe out an entire city's paranormal population; and Dorian recognizes the magic involved - you guessed it, family. The only way to stop it is to try and get the entire city to work together, but that is like herding cats, literally and figuratively, maybe. If the spell Dorian used in this book was real, I would be the first in line to purchase it, because who wouldn't like to loose a few pounds and never see them come back? Especially if it helped a guy like him?
I love this series and the characters that we are being introduced to. I cannot wait to see what is next for Dorian. I am waiting on pins and needles to see who, or maybe what Mikas is to him and how Dorian's apprentice is. I have always wanted to find a good series to read where the main character always continues on and their story develops as the world continues. I do believe I have found that story. Move over Sookie Stackhouse, Dorian Devil is the new main character to follow."
Kindle_Store_5,5,CG,"This review is for one of the free books in this series.  This is the first book in the series.  The second book is also free.

This is a short story with a lot of sexual tension.  The story is told in two parts.  The first part is a fast paced story.  The second part is a more mature story.  I liked it a lot.  The story is told from the POV of the main character, Luke, who is a vampire hunter.  The sex scenes are very hot.  I liked that the main character, Luke, was a bit of a jerk, but it didn't bother me that he had a big heart.  The story was a bit different from the first book in the series.  I will be reading the first book in the series.

This book was a good read.  I really enjoyed it.  I was not disappointed in this book.  It was a good story.  It is about a good guy, but also about a bad guy.  The characters were well written.  I was very excited to read the next book.  This is the second book in the series.  I really liked this book.  It is about a good guy, but also about a bad guy.  I was glad to see that"

Kindle_Store_5,2,OR,"It was so freaking long! There was just too much detail and I really didn't need to know every move they made every day. Very flowery, sappy dialogue was used a lot. I disliked Chase's prejudiced generalization that bisexual men are predisposed to cheat because they are attracted to both sexes. Cheaters are predisposed to cheat and it has nothing to do with sexuality. And he had that viewpoint prior to the boyfriend that cheated with a woman.

I also disliked the fact that Gray spent 10 years with Devon and dismissed it all so casually. Devon should never have cheated and never should have stayed if their relationship was so bad for 4 whole years. Maybe he was as manipulative as he was depicted. But Gray should be blamed as well, when he was the one avoiding intimacy and was too lazy and too complacent to make a clean break. Also, later in the book, he said he owned his house before Devon and Devon only lived there for a year. After 10 years together? That makes no sense.

I know that much of the story was introducing characters for future stories and I liked some of them. I did make it through the whole story but it was a chore. I never connected with the characters. They both seemed immature in many ways. Their little breakup was ridiculous and was no more than a setup for another long sappy make up scene. Added nothing to the book. So I might read the next book because of other characters but only if they're written more cleanly and with less syrupy dialogue."
Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"I've read a lot of new adult romance books lately, so I've seen how a lot of them are the same, or how they differ.  I think anyone who reads a lot will kind of fall into that trap sometimes.  We always want something similar, but... not too much, you know?  To recapture that feeling that we had while reading something else, but to get a sense of more and a feeling of excitement, too.

This book is definitely that.  Right from the start, the entire thing catches you.  I honestly didn't expect what I was reading, but I liked it.  Caught and roped in, basically, and I wanted more.

Hopelessly Broken definitely provides more, too.  There's a lot going on in this book.  The characters are interesting and realistic.  I really enjoyed reading about Aeron especially.  I don't know that I've seen any character quite like him in another book.  Jenn's struggles are oftentimes something I think a lot of us can relate to, also.  Maybe not exactly, but the ideas and concepts behind them, you know?  I don't want to give too much away, but for a book like this to be as realistic was it was, I was impressed with how Tawny Taylor went about it.

One warning is that there's apparently another one planned for the future, so you're definitely going to want to keep an eye out for that.  Hopelessly Broken is on the longer side, though, so it's definitely really satisfying on its own.  I can't wait to read the second part!"

This book starts off with Vaughn in the hospital, hell bent on finding Lark, who has stolen something that is very precious to him.  It is immediately apparant that these two have a history (which may have been revealed in the other books that I haven't read yet).  Once Vaughn is healed he sets out to find the elusive woman that stole not only property from him, but his heart as well.

Lark is on the run from her past.  No one knows who she truly is and she can't let anyone ever find out or else she is a dead woman.  Running has recently become harder after he last stop.  Not only did she make some really good friends but she went and fell in love as well.  That is how she knew it was time to move on, she promised never to let herself get too attached to anyone ever again.

With the help of his brother and a few close friends Vaughn is able to track lark down.  However, things aren't exactly as they appear and once he finds out who Lark really is there is nothing he won't do to protect the woman he loves and bring her back home where she belongs.

Everyone should have a Jack.
Ben has admitted to Jack that hes tired of being a one-nighter and hes ready to settle.  Both Jack and his love, Melody, are skeptical.  Youve never had a boyfriend, barely spent more than one night with a guy.  But Bens thirty-four and hes thinking of changing.  Of course, first we have to celebrate the birthday, where he gets an eyeful of the gorgeous stripper, Sawyer.  Lust at first sight, here we come.  Sawyer shows his talents during the dance and Ben is smitten.
Things are a little bit more than they seem and Jack has a hand in wanting Bens dream man wish to come true.  I wonder how Ben will handle his man still stripping for others, as I could see that being a problem. When he asks if Sawyer often gives lap dances, Why: Does that bother you?  Not that it matters, its part of the job.  Its early days yet, so hopefully they will get it to work.

The Nameless Dwarf Omnibus contains the first three stories following the dwarf known only as Nameless.  If you have read some of Derek's other work than you may be familiar with him as he has been a companion of Shadrak the Unseen and Deacon Shader.

The book starts out with Nameless being a very mysterious figure who has hired a boy from the Night Hawks (a criminal group) to help him find information on where his people have fled to.  Nils, his companion, is the son of the leader of the guild out to prove his worth as a man.  During the journey they meet up with Silas, a magic user, who is studying the stolen grimoire of the Liche Lord Otto Blightey.  At the end of Ant-Man Ilesa joins up with the group as well.  She is a woman who seems to have some level of skill with shapeshifting/illusion magic.  As the stories progress the characters true natures are revealed as their stories are unraveled.  Derek has done a wonderful job keeping the main story on point while gradually revealing the backgrounds of all the people involved.

The book starts out with a lot of information and someone who is unfamiliar with the world Derek has created might struggle a bit at first.  As the book progresses everything comes together beautifully and by the end I didn't want to stop reading for any reason.  I will also be checking out the next story in the series, The Ebon Staff as soon as possible to see what will happen.

Kindle_Store_5,4,OR,"There is no good way to review this book without giving the plot away and all I can say is that this is a extremely complex book with lots of twists and turns. There where times I did go out to Google to research some of the mythology mentioned in the book to round out the reading for my self-need but it is not necessary for the reader to do that in order to enjoy this book.

The author creates a very interesting world involving mythology and a large variety of complex characters drawing the reader deep into her fantasy world. Readers will be curious with the plaything, Damon and his story while wondering who he really is. As the story unwinds who he is becomes clearer and you will have that ""AH HA"" moment and feel at peace with him and his story.

Meanwhile Elysia, another aspect of this story, continues to draw your attention in another direction worth investigating. Elysia is a great example of how a woman would handle life threatening situations when there is no choice but to live. Her believable character will draw the reader closer with the desire to see her succeed and get her hearts desires.

Secondary characters are numerous and the reader will be able to tell that their stories were written in previous books to this series but this will not be a problem to reading this book.

Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"I enjoy this series for the facts that it is science fiction and erotic and a little kick ass. I love the characters for not being boring but having some larger than life personalities with just the right amount of neurosis to make them very human and likeable. The worlds that they inhabit are just as varied as the people that live on them. This is the story of Steffania Rickard and Ramsey DeKieran's, the Captain of the Blue Daggers and a disgraced Lord who was found guilty of murder.

Captain Rickard is sent to bring Ramsey to meet with Ari and Doral to discuss a mission they wish him to under take that could mean a full pardon for him, if he returns. Ramsey has been a part of her fantasies since they fought side by side in the Haarb wars, but she would never give into them. Ramsey finds the Captain attractive but knows a woman like her could never give in to the types of hungers he has. Both are very wrong.

The pair are sent to bring back a Verdantian who is very important to the survival of the planet, Lady Alessa DeAlbero has been sold to Veacon Narr, a man who takes pleasure in bringing women to their knees. Everyone else who has attempted a rescue has not returned and he is considered to be expendable even if Steffania isn't. But together they find a way to do the impossible.

Though the story revolves around their rescue effort it is really about two people who have had the worst happen to them but are finding someone to complete them. Highly recommend."

The story was really involved with politics playing a major role and a tenuous treaty between shifters and humans hanging in the balance. Avelyn grew up in a school for girls dedicated to become mates for shifters. Each girl was assigned to a category of shifter, Fox, wolf, bear, Dragon, eagle. Evelyn was to be a Fox bride but she sabotaged herself by pretending to learn nothing and getting fat and failing interviews with prospective grooms. All she wanted was freedom. She was 3 months away from total freedom when Max Blackmane, Alpha werewolf, came to the school looking to buy a wife. Instead of a wolf bride, he chose the sassy Avelyn, who tried her best to fail,  even trying to run away. But they go to his home together where she feels trapped, unloved, frantic to leave. He is very patient with her and loves her spirit. But he hides something from her that may be his undoing and bring about the downfall of his clan. Evelyn cannot bear injustice and unfairness, so she will go against even her growing feelings for Max to see fairness done. Thus begins a time of terror for the Blackmane family, clan, surrounding villages, Europe, Avelyn's old school, possibly the world as they know it! Got you hooked?? Well, read the book!

Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"Leather & Lace: Inferno Glory MC #1 by J.A. Fredericks is the first book in the Inferno Glory MC four-part serial. It is the story of Harley Sonnick and Colt Sawyer. It is NOT a rosy and warm story full of happy feel-good moments. It is a story filled with mistakes, regrets, deceit, danger, and betrayal.

We meet Harley when she is fresh out of prison. She just served three years for a crime she was set up for and unknowingly committed. She lost her dad while she was locked up, his battle with lung cancer finally over. She goes to the only place she has ever called home, the Inferno Glory MC clubhouse. When she gets there, the man who has always been another father figure to her turns his back on her. This is when she meets Colt. With no place to go she begrudgingly takes him up on his offer to crash at his place for a short while. It doesn't hurt that he is OFF THE CHARTS HAWT!!!!

Colt is instantly enamored with the vixen on two wheels and jumps at the chance to be her (paraphrasing book) knight in a leather cut riding in on his black hog to save her. The love/lust is kinda insta-lust that grows into some deep feelings fast and the sex is raunchy and will melt your undies right-off.

Despite the romantic aspect there is an undercurrent of subterfuge and suspense and the book ends on a cliffhanger in anticipation of the next book, Pleasure & Pain: Inferno Glory MC #2. I thoroughly enjoyed this quick read and can't wait to see what's going to happen next!"

The characters were so"
Kindle_Store_5,4,OR,"If you haven't read anything in the Wine of the Gods series...book 18 is not a good place to start.  I really like this universe (multiverse?), but there are so many characters and so much about the world(s) that is hinted at it becomes a bit overwhelming.  Unless you have read the whole series and have the background.

That being said, for those of you who are fans this adds a wonderful new group of magic users to the mix.  Having some new blood to add to the already defined groups should shake things up nicely.  We also see more action by mage compass's, which is a nice change from the usual witches pyramids.  Some of the first hints of a coming tech/magic revolution that may make the industrial revolution look like a minor upgrade.  A whole new pyramid also is peeking around the edges.

Now for the bad:  Much as I like this world ^and^ the writing, this is not a good short story.  This is more of a chronology of what happened.  While some of the characters learned new skills or information, we did not.  More about filling in the blanks and backstory than developing a character.

There is a teaser at the end of the book showing the next(?) in the series that gives me a lot of hope.  The Sea Kings!!  An almost unexplored area.

In closing, I liked it.  Fans will like it.  Everybody else needs to start earlier in the series, if not at the beginning, and develop a love for this world in order to appreciate this story."
Kindle_Store_5,3,OR,"I liked the story.  By now you know what the story is about so I won't go into that.  I thought the storyline was good.  I did feel sorry for the Hero who was cheated out of 10 years of his son's life.  He was 2 years older than her and she was a college graduate, so he had to be around 25 or so.  I think in his drunken state he was just popping off more than he really meant the words he said.  I realize to make the story work she had to run.

She did make a lot of dumb choices and she did seem very immature and weak when she was suppose to be such a strong character.  I could almost deal with all of that.  What got on my last nerve, and SPOILER here, was her insecurities.  Good grief, what does a guy have to do to convince you he means what he says.  She did take responsibility for some of her bad choices so I will give her that.  She was rather annoying and not a heroine that inspired a lot of affection.  Seems he was made to grovel and she was the one that ran rather than staying and discussing things with him.  But, this is one of those stories you need to read for yourself.  I found it very interesting and I definitely would recommend it.  I did read some of the low star reviews and I had to agree with a lot of what they said but I did like the story."

Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"I am so glad I picked this up on Kindle Unlimited. The lead female, Avery, is mostly strong and determined to make it on her own, if a bit naive when it comes to her ""best friend"". The lead male, Chase Winters. WOW!!!  He's the MMA heavyweight champion, capable of inflicting serious damage. His strength of character is as strong as his muscle. When Chase witnesses a heated discussion between Avery and another MMA fighter who wants to be more than friends and sees Avery get pushed against the concrete wall so hard you can hear her head hit it from over 10 feet away, Chase intervenes, telling the guy point blank YOU NEVER HIT A WOMAN. After the threat to Avery is removed, Chase watches over and tends to Avery, ensuring she gets the care she needs. Deciding this girl is the one for him, Chase proceeds to give his heart by absolutely cherishing Avery at every turn. He cares for her, he protects her, he respects her. This is a guy who knows how to be the alpha male without being over-the-top possessive and controlling. Chase Winters is all that and then some. It helps that Chase has a good friend watching his back (Dale) and a GREAT relationship with a TERRIFIC father. Their presence story really helps develop insight into how Chase became such a good guy. especially that of his father. What a great role model. You'll love him, too. I will definitely be looking for more from this author. This is an easy read and a sweet (Sweet) story."
Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"This is my first book by this author, so I didn't really know what to expect. I found the beginning of the story a little bit hard to get into - not because it was badly written, but because of the subject matter that it covers. Cassie, the heroine, suffers a traumatic event that will shape the rest of her life. How she deals with this affects not only herself but those around her. The event is not allowed to rest though, the perpetrator come back to haunt her.

Once the story moves into the present day, it became a wonderful, emotional and gripping story. One that certainly lives up to the term ""a real page turner"". Cassie meets her one and only love, her soul mate in Jordan - their story together is simply beautiful. But due to decisions she makes, Cassie loses eveything, causing not only her life to be affected, but Jordan's as well.

They say that separation makes the heart grow fonder - for Cassie this is so true. Jordan is never far from her mind or her heart. He loves her and he also has the ability to give her the strength that she needs. The heartbreak that this woman suffers is devastating, but it is one which gives her strength to deal with all adversity.

This story is amazing, an emotional rollercoaster that will draw you in. The characters that Krissy V has written were superb - they are one that will live in your heart and mind for a long time after the book is finished and put down.

A highly recommended read.

Kindle_Store_5,3,OR,"A romantic mystery with a touch of suspense.

An Opportunity Seized caught my attention with its name. I immediately thought that this was a workplace/office mystery. After reading the book I am still not sure what the title has to do with the story.

Toni is an heiress, the daughter of a mining magnate, who just wants to be normal whereas Jason is ex-military and co-owner of Haven Security. Jason is the bodyguard hired by Tonis father.

While guarding her he develops feelings for her. She falls for him, too. A relationship that was almost impossible to begin with is tested when a mining accident threatens the whole family.

One thing I liked about the relationship was that though both of them were immensely attracted to each other, they also get to know each other on a deeper level than just chemistry. This part of their relationship is shown clearly after the mining accident.

Readers who enjoy frequent sex will be pleased with this short story. It wasn't the hard core erotic variety but there is enough to make a reader who isn't used to reading it to possibly become either uncomfortable or start blushing like crazy.

That being said this is still a mystery. I think the beginning was a little slower than the ending. The ending seemed a little fast paced, which I loved.

This is a romantic mystery, heavy on the sexual elements. It worked for me because there was enough of the mystery plot to offset some of the romance.

The ending was a full of surprises. The twists and turns and the new information that were revealed kept me reading to the very end.

Kindle_Store_5,4,OR,"This is the second book in Barbour's holiday series. Well-written plot with realistic characters that has no real connection to the Christmas holiday other than the setting. Deputy Shawna Mallory is a thirty-one year old single cop who lives in the rather sleepy town of Carlton Grove. She has a deep commitment to her job, and moves quickly when she hears an amber alert on the radio for a missing eleven year old boy. Mallory hears a dog barking; she finds the boy under a snow drift being guarded by the pup. The sheriff agrees to take the boy in while he awaits a new foster care family.

Complications arise when the boy's real father arrives back on the scene from an overseas assignment in Chile. John Reid McCrae appears to have a poor parenting track record, but Shawna's friend Alice knew him many years ago and offers a different opinion. In the meantime Shawna grows attached to Billy, who is about to be given to a new foster family. Billy runs away once again, but even more puzzling is the strange affect Billy's dad has upon Shawna. What outcome ensues for Billy, John, and the Deputy Sheriff whose lives have become entangled.

A heartwarming story revolving around coming of age, domestic violence, foster care, romance, pets and peer relationships that will tear at the heart strings of young adult and adult readers. Actually, the book could be a middle grade read if one is willing to look past a few curse words and one or two light romantic scenes. Snow Pup is the kind of story that will put the reader in the mood for the holiday season."

Kindle_Store_5,4,OR,"I was provided a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.

I admit, that I was a little confused at first. The person who wrote the ""Single Guy"" column, was he Matthew Rhodes, or Ryan, or were they the same guy?  After I figured that out, it was pretty smooth sailing.

Ryan's column was a somewhat cynical view of Love, and the column Mia wrote, ""Lonely Girl"", was more about single women navigating the dating scene. When Ryan and Mia first met, they each had no idea they were with the person behind the column. Their focus was on the 'reality' of Love as they saw it.

They had great chemistry going until Mia figured out that Ryan was Lonely Guy and bolted. They both end up on a Bachelor type dating show as contestants. They each have their own agenda for appearing, and it is not to fall in love. Both Ryan and Mia were shocked to find out they were both going to be on the show.  I did love their back and forth teasing and wittiness in their conversations.

One not believing in love. The other feeling unlovable. There was blackmail, corruption, deceit, manipulation, love, loyalty, and family throught this book. Let's not forget a few steamy sex scenes. There is a HEA, no worries there.

This was a fun, romance read. My only regret was there was no detail on Mia's boss ever getting what was coming to her. I also wasn't 100% sure if Ryan got to write the article that he really wanted to and use some of the information against Mia's boss. I was left wanting more.

Maybe that's a good thing...."
Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"Going Against Type by Sharon Black (click here for Author Wednesday guest post) went toward my type of delightful light-hearted contemporary romance set in Dublin, Ireland. The genre hearkens back to the 1950s with mismatched lovers such as Katherine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy, albeit with Irish eyes and tastes.

Charlotte ""Charlie"" Regan yearns to find her place in a world dominated by men as a sports' reporter and columnist. The hero of the story also fights for his place in the world of fashion writing where men are in short supply. It doesn't help matters that they work for harshly competitive newspapers and somehow find themselves pitted against one another when Charlie steps into the world of fashion by criticizing the footballers of Ireland for advertising popular name brands.

The novel reverberates with authenticity of the life of a journalist always under pressure to be fast, accurate, and edgy. Ms. Black, herself a journalist, paints a realistic picture of both Charlie and Derry despite their opposite views. I liked the twist in the story that turned stereotypes on end. It reminded me a bit of the movie with Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks, You've Got Mail. For most of the novel, neither Charlie nor Derry know the other one is the author behind the viperous attacks in the two rival columns written anonymously. In the meantime, they begin dating, enjoying their time together more each time.

If you want to escape for a few hours into the world of Irish football, fashion, and foibles, you won't be disappointed with Going Against Type. I think it's the first Irish novel I've read that wasn't historical, which makes it both refreshing and light."

The sex in this book was steamy!! the ups and downs, the run ins with the paparazzi were all so real. There never was a dull moment in the book. This is the second book of Robins I have read I loved the first but this one I think I loved even more. I loved that Piper was a strong woman that even though she had a failed public engagement she kept going she built her self back up again on her own terms.

Michaela Western, is one of the very few women cruise directors around, and she intends to keep the respect she has earned the hard way. Until she sees Dylan, who makes her rethink a few things, but she has to be careful or she could be fired: on-board romances are frowned upon.

Ill put is simply: THE BOSS AND HER BILLIONAIRE is excellent! Its so very well written; Ms. DeWintons prose is very expressive, flowing and so easy to read. THE BOSS AND HER BILLIONAIRE really made me want to go on such a cruise: the author describes the ship and the setting  Australia and New Zealand  so well, I felt I was there. I also love how Ms. DeWinton portrays the dance environment and the performers; that was a lot of fun. Dylan and Michaela are both such fabulous characters. Michaela is very confident in her abilities, but she is almost all-business all the time; she cares almost too much about her job and she desperately tries to rein in her passionate nature. Dylan is seductive and charming, but not aggressive; still he decides Michaela will relax even if it kills him. The chemistry between Michaela and Dylan is sizzling and feels very real.

I love the playfulness and the interactions between Dylan and Michaela; Dylan is quite a wonderful hero and steps up when needed. THE BOSS AND HER BILLIONAIRE is a wonderful romance, sexy and yet very realistic as the romance progresses naturally. HE BOSS AND HER BILLIONAIRE is fresh, colourful, fun and very entertaining!"

WOW!!!

I really enjoyed this book. It was not the best I've read in a while. There was a lot of action, and a little bit of romance in it. There was also some sex. There was also a bit of a cliff hanger, and I'm not sure if it was due to the ending or because I didn't want to put the book down.

I loved the main characters. They were very likable, and the sex scenes were hot. They were also a bit steamy.

Kindle_Store_5,4,OR,"This book had captured my attention as I had read one of her books from her series Love's Great Adventure and what appealed most was that this book was to be set in New Zealand and since I am from New Zealand, I enjoy books set here. The book starts over in America with Alicia discovering her cheating husband and then escaping over here to make a fresh start. She moves to Auckland where she has an IT job and moves next door to Tia, Hunter and Mick. What I liked about Alicia is that she is quite naive and this made her character funny and made her more relatable. As the book goes along we read as Hunter and Alicia start gaining great chemistry and though neither is officially ready for a relationship, they both seem to work great together and they get all hot and heavy. If you love Second Chance New Adult romances, then this is the book for you. The only thing I didn't like about this book was the language as being from New Zealand , I am used to how we do things here and our language. The author used phrases like Kia Ora as hello since the character next door was Maori and the word Pakeha and tribe. I know often it can be difficult for American writers to grasp the different cultural differences and language. Overall though it was only tiny things that unless you are from New Zealand, you wouldn't notice or pick up.  Honestly, if you are on the lookout for a lovely second chance at happiness and romance story then By My Side is the book for you."

Footsteps stomped with the force of a giant on the wooden steps. Pounding in synchronization with each ragged inhale Nikki took.
Dang it. The door. Just as she lunged forward to lock it, the handle turned. She jumped back. This is probably nothing, just an innocent mix up in dates. But then again She lifted the spoon over her head.

The only thing I can say is that I am a huge fan of the Tuckers. I love that they are so realistic and in the moment they are there for each other. I love how the authors always keep their characters real. I love how the story is told from the perspective of each of the characters. It is so easy to see what is going on in their heads. I love how they are able to get their feelings for each other, and how they keep it real.

I enjoyed the writing and the characters. I liked the way the characters kept their personalities to themselves and their relationships. I loved the fact that the author does not give up on the story and how it is told. I also liked how the author does not give up on the book.

Kindle_Store_5,4,OR,"When Cass Stone and Logan Alexander meet, it's not love at first sight. Both pretending to be someone that they're not, neither Cass nor Logan was looking for more than a fun night, with no strings, then they'd go their separate ways. Funny how things never go as planned.

Fast forward two years. Cass is an independent successful woman, striving to be taken seriously in a field dominated by men. Life has not turned out exactly as she'd expected, but she is smart and secure enough in herself and her goals to roll with the changes that life has thrown her way. Finding herself a single mom, she has more than risen to the occasion, and is raising Olivia with the love that she never experienced in her own childhood.

While Logan has spent the last two years dedicated to his job, he hasn't ever forgotten that night with Cass. When the two meet again, it's like the sexual tension has been simmering under the surface, and like they haven't been apart at all. Finding out that Cass (or Miss Mary, as he calls her; seriously sexy!) and he have a daughter rocks his world. Even though he is angry that she's kept Olivia from him (or so he thinks), he can't fight the attraction for Cass that's still as strong as ever.

I thoroughly enjoyed this book. There is humor, intrigue (it's a spy story, after all!), passion, and so much love. The characters are well-developed and likeable, the kind of people that you absolutely want to hang out with. Paula Altenburg has written a book that drew me in and kept me reading, and I look forward to reading more from her."
Kindle_Store_5,5,CG,"I will admit that it was an easy read, and I did not need to read the full length story. I had a lot of fun with the characters and the plot. I enjoyed that it was a little short. I will admit that I was disappointed with the shortness of the story. I liked the shortness of the story, and it was a little short. I liked the ending, but I did not like the fact that it ended a little abruptly. I would have liked to see more of the relationship between the two main characters. Overall, it was a good read and a short story. It was a good read. This was a good story, but I did have a few issues with the writing. I don't think I've read a book that has a relationship between the two main characters, but I did find that I could relate to both of them. I was just not very happy with the way the book ended. It felt like the main character was trying to make her way back to her life, and the story ended abruptly. I was hoping that the author would have a more happy ending, but I didn't feel it. I felt like the book was rushed and I had a hard time getting through it. It felt like it was rushed and just a lot of time was spent on the book."
Kindle_Store_5,4,OR,"This story, Unruly Hearts, really delivered the romance that I was looking for in spades. I found West simply irresistible, the combination of hot, handsome, well-intentioned neighbor struggling with awkwardly emerging lover along with a heroine who stars in this story for much more than her beauty was perfect. The love that grew between West and Annie reminded me of what my mother told me about love - when a man says he loves you when you look your best, it's a compliment, when he says it in the garden and you're covered in dirt, it's a declaration! In this story you also get a second romance, a mix-up on engagements, and a really nasty villain! Another thing I liked about this story was the strong female friendships that are too seldom found in literature. This story was well written and the story flowed well. The imagery was exceptionally well done; I could practically see, hear, smell, and especially taste the dust behind the cattle. The only false note in the story was Clara. I felt her hesitation about setting a wedding date didn't fit her character and her indecision about marrying West when she had feelings for Jones just plain felt wrong to me. That's why I gave this story four stars instead of five but even with this one flaw, it's still a very enjoyable romance with some graphic lovemaking but no vulgar language. (The reason I said ""lovemaking"" is there is nothing more than passionate kissing until West and Annie are engaged. ) For anyone looking for a historical western romance that makes you give a big smile at the HEA ending, then I definitely recommend this one."

I love the fact that the characters are both strong and independent. I love that the heroine has a lot of experience in the M/M genre. I also loved that the hero is a strong and independent woman. The heroine was more determined than most to be the best in her life. I loved that she took a risk in her life and found her way back to the best. I loved that she was determined to get to where she needed to be and that she wasn't afraid to take it.

Kindle_Store_5,3,OR,"Sky High was a short and sweet read but it didn't exactly deliver all that I expected it to.

Some books that I have read make every character seem important no matter how trivial their role was, but this book wasn't one of them. While reading this book, a lot of times I thought that a character wasn't a significant part of the book and this didn't just happen during the book, It also happened after I had finished it. I kept thinking about the book and all of the characters inside it and they just didn't seem important enough even though I know they were.

What Im trying to say here is that, in my opinion, this book lacked some sort of execution or finesse that could have taken it from being just another good book to an amazing one. I never for one second doubt that C.J. Lake holds talent for story writing but all Im saying is that it needs a little bit more work.

Other than that, the story was sweet, romantic and also quite hot. Even though a lot of characters appeared to be minor, I did love the main characters and the chemistry between those two. The relationship between those two was something to envy. Their banter, their romance, their attraction toward one another was extremely enjoyable to read.

In the end, I wouldnt say that reading this book was a waste of my time but I also won't be reading it a second time. Nevertheless, I will be reading other works of C.J. Lake to look for better versions of Sky High. And when I read one like that, let me tell you well have a winner on our hands."
Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"This novel is so real.  There is nothing farfetched or out of this world that happens.  Everything is completely plausible and even probable.  The story itself is emotional and heartfelt.  It is in essence a story about overcoming the worst of hardships, yet it is so much more.  Harrisons understated, mellow, yet still vivid descriptions craw you into the world that shes created.  Her use of the real as opposed to the worst case scenario makes it easy to relate to, thus incorporate yourself into, the story.  I definitely feel like Ive set foot in Oz after reading this tale.

The characters were amazing as well.  I really appreciate how strong and independent the main character was.  She also was less than perfect, allowing readers to relate to her on a personal level, because you do get to know her quite well.  The supporting cast in this novel is divided into 2 groups:  those who are verging on main character status and those who help propel the story forward.  The first group are extremely well developed, becoming individuals that you feel youve met in the real world.  The second group has a range of development that pertains directly to their role in the story.  Overall, Harrison has created a brilliant cast to carry her story forward.

Final thoughts?  I definitely cant wait to dig into more by this talented author.  However, I must say that I was dying for an Aussie Shiraz by then end of the novel.  Be warned!

Please note that I received this novel free of charge from the author in exchange for an honest review."
Kindle_Store_5,3,CG,"This was an Amazon freebie and I received an ARC in exchange for an honest review.

While I read the first two books, I didn't really care for the rest of the story. The first one was really good, but the second one was really bad. There was no real story to it.

I did get a little frustrated with the hero and heroine, but I didn't really care about them. I think that they were all just a bunch of idiots.

I really liked the hero, and I really liked the heroine. She was a strong heroine who had a lot of issues. She was a bit naive at the beginning, but she grew on me as the book progressed.

I really liked the villain, and he was a good guy. He was a bit of a jerk, but I didn't care about him.

I really liked the ending. I was hoping that there would be a sequel. It didn't really happen.

I did like the other characters, but I didn't like the ending. I would have liked to have had more characters.

I really liked the ending. It was a nice little surprise.

Overall, I was really impressed with this book. I would recommend it to anyone who likes a good story, with some twists and turns.

Kindle_Store_5,4,OR,"After reading the first book in this series I was super excited to receive this advanced copy from Charlotte Raine.

The girl that was kidnapped in the first book is now back with her family and working in a The Charcoal grill.

Is she over her experience? Is she heck. Its left her with a few scars, emotional. There is a reference in there to a phrase, it is reflecting how a human can harbor a beast, a wolf, everyone has hidden nasty tendencies, well, this is what I took away from it.

The guy who own the Charcoal grill is a bit of a perv, he doesn't care who sees him watching dirty sexual video's on his PC, no matter who walks in. However, the other side of him makes advances to his staff. He justifies this because the small town doesn't have that many jobs, so who can leave? Who can complain? Who can afford to loose they're job?

She is safe though, as she has an important father!

We have a death of Zoe. Then we have a death of another girl, both deaths a carbon copy of each other although the time zone in between is distance.

Getting into the mind of a certain character in the book was weird, eerie and creepy.

I just don't want to give the game away in this book 2 as its so cleverly written and I don't believe in spoilers.

I have to say........the conclusion of this book has left it WIDE OPEN and its not the usual cliff hanger in a book, but it has its GASPING factor.

A really enjoyable read.

Kindle_Store_5,3,OR,"I have mixed feelings about this book.  At times I loved it; other times I threw it across the room.  The information on writing reviews, Listmania, and So You'd Like To...Guides was extremely valuable.  Knowing how Amazon uses this information to get more exposure for your book is worth the price of the book.

But there were a lot of questions that remained unanswered.  Author Connect was somewhat confusing.  I asked quite a few people to access an author's profile page and no one succeeded. Amazon customers will follow the path of least resistance. If these are so well hidden that Brent has to give you a web address to put in to find it, how are the readers supposed to uncover this ""useful"" information?  They won't.  I understand that isn't the Brent's fault, but why should I spend my time doing something potential buyers can't find, even if it's free!

Buy X Get Y could have been more detailed.  There is more to pairing books than selecting a title.  Is it worthwhile to pair your book with a top selling title that has a one or a two-star review as a Spotlight Review?  What if the title you select is in the top 10 in sales, but sells for 1/2 the price of yours?  Is it a good match?  I don't expect Brent to do all the work, but I do feel these are valid questions that should have been addressed.

If you look at most of the 5 star reviews, you will see that they are nothing more than shameless self-promotions of books written by the reviewers.  That should tell you something."

Kindle_Store_5,4,OR,"Why I Picked It Up
By now you can deduce that I am interested in any book that involves musicians. So of course I had to pick this one up, especially considering the fact that it hinted at a best friends romance.

Plot

It was that and more. The story of Chloe and Noah was complicated to say the least and it hooked me in. Seeing their struggles, seeing the two of them fighting their attraction, and trying to live life in the spotlight kept me engaged from the very beginning.

Leading Lady

Chloe was a great character. She cared for Noah. She was excited to get a new start. She was happy and determined. On the other hand, she had a backbone and didn't take crap from anyone, especially her ex or Noah's ex.

Leading Male

Noah was sweet, talented, and humble which you don't find in many of the musician characters in novels nowadays. I absolutely fell in love with him and his charms.

Romance

I liked the way that Wicks evolved this plot. I loved seeing a bit of the back-story of the two characters, both individually and together. It really gave their relationship depth. Their relationship was fun with, of course, some drama. I loved the tension between the two of them for the first half of the novel. I enjoyed how their relationship grew more and more. And of course, I adored the fact that they were friends first and foremost. They were perfect for each other and complimented each other very well. I hope we see some of them in the companion novel.

Conclusion

Overall, Before He Was Famous was a great book about friends to lovers with a dash of famous musician: the perfect recipe for a great book."

Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"This is the same story as Jag but from Roxy's POV. There is a lot that you learn about Roxy and why she is the way she is. It really awesome to see things from her POV which made for a more well rounded story. She really is a strong person and I really admire her.
Jag and Roxy are definitely a unique couple. They started out basically hating each other (or close to it) and it basically boiled down to several chance meetings where they poked at each other. This was extremely amusing to read about. Jag has serious drug problems and unfortunately a huge part of that is is rock career and the people in it that put a lot of pressure on him. Not to mention his ex-girlfriend from before he became famous. Roxy grew up with a drug dealer father and brother who OD'd so she's seen that side of things and wants nothing to do with it. She turns out to be Jag's saving grace and the light at the end of the tunnel so to speak. Despite all their personal problems, they truly are a fantastic couple.
I loved how raw and emotional the story line was. It felt like it could be one of those documentaries about a real life situation. I felt deeply invested with the characters and hoping for a good outcome. It's definitely not for those that like all the flowery words and a perfect story because it's far from that. But in it's own way it is perfect because of all they both had to endure. I absolutely loved this book and I can't wait to read about the other band members. 5 out of 5 stars!"

Kindle_Store_5,4,OR,"This review is also posted on my blog: theshortreviewer.blogspot.com

I normally enjoy stories that are told through the viewpoint of someone you can feel for--you know, a good guy or girl. Being that I knew this story would be told through the eyes of someone truly evil, then I got past that and found myself both intrigued and utterly disgusted at the same time. I do like a good disturbing thriller after all. And this book certainly delivered on that.

Fearlessly written, the author holds absolutely nothing back. This is not an exaggeration. The main character is a serial killer, and you are taken into his sick and twisted mind. The repetitiveness of his thoughts is indicative of how I believe someone like him would think. I had no empathy for this character at all. I found myself hoping this was fiction and not an autobiography in disguise! That is how good of a job the author does with bringing you inside this psycho's demented world.

The story is graphic, and many of the scenes are deeply horrifying and troubling. And what is even more terrifying is that there are people out there who do commit atrocious crimes such as this. So even though this is fiction, it is probably more realistic than most of us would like to believe.

It often read more like a diary, where the killer tells a lot of his story, and the dialogue is limited. It was a short, quick read, and I do sincerely hope for a sequel. The story did not feel finished as there is definitely more to be told here.

I recommend this for anyone who thinks they can take it for what it is - a messed up and gritty story."
Kindle_Store_5,4,OR,"In this book, David Birkenhead is still technically a rabbit, but he's now a free rabbit, no longer considered a slave by law.  But as he recovers from his injuries and considers his future, it's clear that most people still consider him to be a slave in all but paper.

As much as the anthropomorphized animal aspects might be weird -- my wife, for example, was a little squicked by it -- it actually served as an interesting proxy for our own history of racial slavery in the U.S.  In many cases I could see people treating the rabbits in much the way old slaveholders of the U.S. south would have treated them, and I also see what that slavery has done to the rabbits psyche, in terms of their expectations, their choices, and their self-image.  More than any furry aspect, it was this comfortable view of slavery that got under my skin more than anything else.

So, this book takes David from his injuries through to his official decoration for his heroic actions in the first book, and then onto the navy's officer academy with the Kings full blessing.  Of course, not everyone wants to see David succeed as the first free rabbit to enter the academy, and there's quite a bit of good struggle over that.  Along the way, he befriends a few other students in the academy, and for the climax, they go to an interstellar wargames competition between two opposing academies.  He acquits himself fairly well in a move that would have made even Ender Wiggin proud.

So, I'm pretty jazzed about it, even with the bunny ears and slavery, and I'm looking forward to the rest of the series."

Brant, Zane, lil Sam and Tanya...Tanya still holding off on sex to get her way??  She's something.  I totally hope Charlene give us story on the Elf Prince..who was the vamp he fell in love with, Brant's secretary?? I'm dying to find out!  Can't wait for Titan to get a mate. He's all messed up, want to read more about that species relations thing, hope there's a shifter females and vamp hook-up, witches were mentioned and did they say dragon shifters....Whoaaaa!  Looking forward to reading that....Keep these fun stories coming Charlene, they're great!"
Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"The Brothers are the authors of childrens books that are as entertaining (and of educational) for adults who read to their children as well!  This is a new series by The Brothers is a learning tool as well as an entertaining well illustrated with photographs book for youngsters who are curious. It is meant to be shared, a starting point for parent/child interaction in learning and opening the field for questions.

This book deals with the number 2  and to give an example of how the book is constructed, the first page starts with a photograph of adult hands holding baby feet. The wording is We have only two hands, two feet, two eyes, two ears
Did you know that? There are 27 bones in the human hand and that only apes hands have a similar structure. Picture, facts, and then further information make this a very interesting format.

Some of the other 2 pages present eyes, sets of teeth, genders (the note courageously mentions the combo  hermaphrodite), two names for autumn, two political parties, sides of a coin, two kinds of pandas, number of humps on a camel, the two World Wars, two million flowers for a bee to make one pound of honey, number of days humans can survive without drinking, number of muscles in a cats ear = thirty TWO, and so forth. The amount of information begins at an (hopefully) obvious level and then disseminates into all manner of topics as the above list suggests. As The Brothers say, Read it the book to your children, speak to them about it and explain it to them. This is one of the more creative and fun books for families. Highly Recommended.

Kindle_Store_5,5,CG,"I'm going to do this book for free. It is a great book for a beginner to start. I read this book in the last few days and have enjoyed it. The characters are well written and well developed. I would highly recommend this book. I really enjoyed this book. The first book was a great read. I read it in one sitting and couldn't put it down. I liked the characters, the story line, and the fact that they all had a very positive impact on the reader. I enjoyed the fact that the author does a great job with the language and the plot. I think it would be great if the story line would have been more developed. I am hoping that the author will take this author to the next level. I can't wait to see what happens with the other characters. This is a very good story with good characters. I wish it had been longer. It was not a bad book but I would have liked more time to get into the characters. I love this series. I was waiting for the next book to come out. I love the characters and how the story unfolded. The ending was a bit abrupt. I don't think this is the end of this series. I liked this book a lot. I didn't like the whole relationship. I just didn't like how it ended. It was too short. I wanted more."
Kindle_Store_5,5,CG,"A friend of mine let me borrow the book and I was delighted to receive a copy.  The story is told from the point of view of the heroine and the hero.  The hero is a well-known military veteran who has fallen in love with his female hero.  The heroine is a woman who has lost her husband and is struggling to make ends meet.  This is a good book for a romance novel.  I recommend it.I have a hard time putting down this book. I loved it. I loved the characters. I'm not sure how I feel about them now. The world building is good. The story is good. The characters are good. I'll be reading more books by this author. I hope there is more to come. I'm a big fan of this author.This is a very good story with good characters. I wish it had been longer.

A lot of the characters in this story are good, but some of the secondary characters are just plain stupid and are not worth the time or effort.

I received this book in exchange for an honest review.This is a great quick read. It is short but it has all the action and romance in a good book. The author made me feel like I was there when it happened. The story line was perfect and the characters were perfect. I will definitely be reading more by this author.This is a short novella"
Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"Oh my gosh I was so happy to receive this ARC, in exchange for an honest review.

Oh my gosh I love Solease Barners The draglen Brothers Series, they are just too darn amazing foreal.  When I finished Gemi I was like oh gosh I need more and more of those darn dragon brothers.  Solease has always kept our attention with each of the draglen brothers each story is always different, and each characters posses their own unique characteristics and dispositions in the book. We are onto the fourth brother who is Gemi. Unlike the other brothers who really weren't searching for a Wella, he has longed for mate to be his other half, the one who is destined to be his.  While in New Orleans he comes across the one person who is his and only his; Shalisi.  Shalisi is not your typical woman, though she is sweet, sexy there is one tiny problem in this possible romance... she is a witch and one of the dragons most mortal enemy. Her destiny is to become a Passer but she must make a difficult decision whether to leave her coven and true calling behind or to be with the dragon who makes her feel, and long for more.  I loved this book oh my gosh im not gonna lie between all of the draglen books this one was by far my most favorite.  Solease wasn't kidding when she said Gemi is far more different from the other brothers in this series and hot damn he was totally amazing for sure.  You have to read the series because each one kind of gives the hint of what's to come in the other upcoming books."
Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"I was given an ARC copy of this to read and review by the author, however I enjoyed it so much I purchased a copy for myself.

This is book two in this new series by Georgette, however it can be read as a standalone. There are brief appearances from the first couple in the series so while it works on its own, I would suggest reading the first book anyway.

Cadence is half werewolf, half dragon. She never knew her father and was raised by her mother with no impact from her father or his family. Since her wolf was most dominant she was able to hide that she was half dragon, however she is changing. Her wolf is gone and her dragon side is beginning to take over. She is unable to hide it any longer and since dragon births are on the decline, she has no choice but to register and subject herself to a forced mating with a complete stranger. However fate was at work when her best friend, Daisy, happened to meet a dragon as he was being ejected by her aunts mating agency. Some quick thinking gets them both in the same room and that is where the real fun begins.

I love this world Georgette has created as well as the two sides to the dragons. The ice dragons and the fire dragons and the war that has always been simmering between them is so interesting. Cadence is an ice dragon and Orion is a fire dragon. They should hate each other, not be falling in love.

This one had action, forbidden romance and a lot of fun moments. One of Georgettes best books in my opinion and I definitely recommend to fans of paranormal romance."

Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"I'll be damned if the secrets and treachery wasn't at an all time high. Toni had me confused for a minute but I kept reading to make sure I wasn't going crazy. Brielle, Chelle and Meachy all found themselves caught up but I wasn't expecting the secrets that came about. Blake was just trifling and doing the most. Here I thought he was messing up one situation but so much more came with it. Brielle was wrong but it was nothing she could do to change the way things panned out. I liked Brandon and his boldness at dinner and that really had me cracking up. I was pissed about the lie he told at his office but I guess he was doing what he thought was best. Eliana seemed like a very sweet person and I hate how what she thought was something special was built from lies. Chelle and Meachy had me so confused but once I started understanding what was what it really threw me for a loop. Meachy's role wasn't excused but she didn't have to let everybody else's secrets out to save her own ass. I'll admit I had a wtf look once Chelle found out Brielle's secret because I was thinking how in the world can she be mad when she's no better. Monique was bitter and wanted her cake and eat it too. Her response to KJ let me know she didn't have it all. Once the secrets started flowing it was like they'd never end. So much trust was broken but the very secrets that destroyed so much also had some good to come about. As always great job Toni and I can't wait to see what you come out with next."

Kindle_Store_5,4,OR,"I love sports romance, but hockey romance is by far my favorite! I now have read all seven of these fabulous Carolina Cold Fury Hockey romances and I have loved them all for different reasons. They all have different types of twists to each of them. Now I have a new favorite, Roman! I loved it and flew through the pages!

I am not going to rehash the story for you as the synopsis gives you a good set up of what the book is about. There is drama. there are steamy love scenes between Lexi and Roman, but it is a slow build with lots of flirting and innuendos and they are so sweet together. It is wonderful to see how their growing infatuation turns into a deep caring relationship.

The new twist to this book is there is a concurrent love story developing between Brian Brannon (Lexis father that she recently found out about from her dying mother) and Lexis free spirited boss Georgia! Lets just say Georgia really knew how to loosen up that stuck-up suit! Another twist is the family dynamics between Brian, Lexi and her half-sister, Gray. Gray had a hard time adjusting to the idea of sharing her father (Brian). Gray, as general manager of the Cold Fury, had issues with Roman and his personal and professional trouble making ways. Roman didn't like her management style, so they agreed to disagree and their disdain for one another put Lexi in a bad position; choose between her new family or the man she was falling in love with.

If you love sports romance that has a bit of drama, fun banter, steamy scenes, touching moments, and crazy secondary characters, then give this book a try. You won't regret it!"

Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"Bought by Nicolette Hugo

Designation: Standalone, 302 pages

Nicolette Hugo is a new author for me and she is one I will be looking for in the future.

The blurb is very accurate, but it really only tells part of the story.  We begin with Killian Bailey trying to rescue his wife who has been kidnapped by the cartel. He saves her, but not before she is permanently harmed.  Killian is also scarred by his failure and puts all his effort into getting revenge on the man who took her.

Although, Scarlet Bailey loves her husband she misses their intimacy since he is punishing himself for failing to protect her so she calls on Jerricho Black, Dom for hire.  Once Killian finds out, he hires Jerricho for 40 days.

So this is quite a complicated plot.  At times it seemed a bit choppy or maybe it was just because there were a few different stories going on.  I really enjoyed the dynamics between Scarlet, Jerricho and Killian.  Jerricho definitely had a complicated past and then the relationship between Scarlet and Killian was unique.  A few times I wanted them to just say what they wanted.  It was one of those books where no one was willing to admit what they wanted and they each thought that what they were doing was protecting the others. Overall we did get an HEA although not a full epilogue.  I still want more.maybe a book 2.

There was also the excerpt from Exhibition at the end which was very intriguing and is now cued on my Kindle.

Hero: Killian 5 stars, Jerricho 5 stars

Kindle_Store_5,4,OR,"This freebie is so worth it. Is short and cute and meaningful. Tork is a homeless young man. I don't get to know the real reason why he is homeless or the real facts about what he endured while being on the street. But his POV had a poignant feel to it that make my heart ache for this lonely man. Adam is a college kid and a world class jerk. He involuntarily volunteer in the shelter in order to get a good reference for college. His had a super-sized ego, rude, selfish, narcissist and etc. I'm sure his character is suppose to make people hate him, but I just laugh it off as part of the humor of the story. Every week Adam reluctantly went to the shelter passing our food parcel, while internally hating the work. This is where he met Tork, the green hair exotic creature that he was not suppose to be attracted to. Anyway, when Tork try to evade Adam at every turn, Adam who suffered a bruised ego, decided to start 'The Invasion of Tork', which I find it extremely sweet and funny despite his motive. Later, Adam start to realize that Tork is more than just a no-good-doer homeless man. Overall, despite the short length of the story and the lack of character background, I love this book and wish it was longer. Seriously. Such good stuff shouldn't be so short. I appreciate the fact that although the pace seems slow, but there is a lot of heart to the story and it makes me cry a few times. I can't wait to buy the sequel now.

Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"This is a sweet book about a loving married couple, Frank and Wendy, with three kids. They've been married over a decade and still love each other a lot, but over time the passion has faded in their sex lives.

Frank is busy with his job as an accountant. He is very methodical. He thinks things are fine between him and his wife, but mostly because he has stopped paying attention. He finds himself masturbating nearly every day, afraid of burdening his wife with his carnal needs.

Wendy is a stay at home mother of three rambunctious boys. She loves her husband, but finds that he no longer satisfies her in the bedroom. She has immersed herself in the erotic novels on her Kindle. The dominant book boyfriends provide her with plenty of masturbatory fantasies to get her through the day. Her BOB (battery operated boyfriend) is her best friend.

Things change when Frank accidentally takes his wife's Kindle to work with him by mistake. He discovers the erotic world that his wife has been visiting, and he realizes for the first time that things may not be as okay as he thought they were.

Frank, using his analytical accountant mind, begins to read, research and analyze the books his wife has been fascinated by. He learns all about BDSM, and dominant/submissive role play. He even joins Fetlife, an online message board for those in the lifestyle. He learns all he can, and he is determined to become the dominant man his wife needs him to be.

This is a standalone novel, and one of the better ones I've read in a while. Don't expect any kind of major angst here. It's just a sweet story of two people rediscovering the passion they once had for each other."

Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"The Lush Life is the 8th book in the Samantha Jamison Mystery series and although each book is a standalone they do somewhat follow from the last I'm lead to believe. This was my first taste of the book series and I'd quite like to read the others at some point. I was a little worried that I wouldn't get into it, but from the beginning you feel like you're part of the sleuth clan and not just the reader.

This book series is based around Samantha or Sam to her friends that is a mystery novelist that turns the crimes she solves, with the help of her friends, into novels. It all started when she didn't get the information she wanted on how her husband died so solved it with the help of a PI named Clay. The Lush Life sees herself being dropped in it when Clay agrees to house sit for a wealthy couple in New Hope they'd both met previously but he couldn't do it due to a prior engagement and so left the house in her capable hands.

As the story continues Sam finds that more and more interesting characters are turning up at the house, some supposedly working for the Worths and others supposedly sent by Clay. But something isn't quite right and so we find ourselves trying to help solve the ever evolving mystery. We are continuously left guessing who could be the culprit.

It really is a fun humorous mystery unlike some that's out there with a mix of other things too like romance, it's perfect for anyone. It keeps the readers interest to the last page making it hard to put down. There is no way you can guess who did it until you reach the final page."

Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"I was gifted an ARC of this boxset from Tasha Black,
also ARC of ""An Impossible Gift"" from Cristina Rayne,
as well as an ARC of ""Wish upon a star"" from Elsa Jade, in exchange for an honest review.

I'm loving this boxset so far, it has some authors I already follow & some new authors being introduced to me. Once I have read a book within, I'll add my reveiw for it.

The Clockwork Dragon by Tasha Black....
I FLOVE Tasha's ""Curse of the Alpha"" & ""Fate of the Alpha"" series & to learn that 'The Clockwork Dragon' is set at Tarker's Hollow.... made me do the happy dance. I was instantly sucked back into the lives of the citizens of Tarkers Hollow & I LOVED it!! Although it's centered around the Magical side of the community of Tarker's Hollow & not the wolves, you still get a scense of being there again. I was LOST in this, the story was rivetting.

An Impossible Gift by Cristina Rayne....
Oh My Goodness! That was short, fast paced & downright AWESOME! This is the first time I've read about Vamps from Cristina, usually it's shifters, but damn this story was good. Fast paced, full of action, loads of background story (you need this, believe me), a hot sexy Vamp who doesn't sparkle, all wrapped into a story about healing.

Wish upon a Star by Elsa Jade....
I am currently HOOKED on Elsa's ""Wolves of Angels Rest"" series, the minute one arrives on my kindle app, I'm devouring it quickly. 'Wish upon a Star' is a part of this series & what a Christmas story it was. It had me gripped from the very start, til the end... & just like the rest of the series, I devoured it & I wanted it to be longer."
Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"Oh no the hell she didn't! I read the first book, Continental Divide, and was devastated by the ending. I wanted Jamie and Remington to get their happily ever after. I craved it. But, no. Laura Harner wouldn't let me have that. Instead she had them walk away from each other. Two years later we find that each of them is with someone new. I instantly hated the new partners because Remy was meant to be with Jamie. I pictured their demise in horrible, awful ways. My heart and head both hurt. I didn't want to like them. I refused. Then it happened. I actually fell in love with the new guys and couldn't see them being separated. Now I'm confused. This is book two of four. I have no idea where it will end, and believe me, I begged Ms. Harner to give me SOME clue, but she's remaining tight-lipped over the whole thing. So read this book, fall in love with some great characters, and delve into a mystery of sex, diamonds, and betrayal. I honestly didn't see this coming. My jaw dropped and I was screaming at my Nook (I do that on occasion, don't judge me!) Oh no the hell she didn't (again!). The author has said that this is going to be a four book series. I'm not sure how it's going to end, but I know that whatever path she takes, someone will be unhappy. I'm not sure who it will be, but I don't envy the author. She's remaining true to her characters and the vision she has laid out. I'm eager to see how it works out, even though I know it's going to cost me a piece of my heart when it's done.

The book is well written and the characters are well developed.  This book is a great series for young people.  I have read the book and can't wait to read the next one.I received a free copy of this book from the author for my honest review.

This book was very interesting to me. It is the first book I've read by this author, and I was very interested in it. It is definitely a book that you don't want to miss!

I found myself wanting to read the next book. I loved how the author takes us back to the first book in the series, and the characters from the first book in the series. I also loved how the author takes us back to the first book in the series, and the end of the first book in the series.

I look forward to reading the next book in the series.I am always on the lookout for more books by this author. I was very impressed with this book. I loved it! It was a really good book.

Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"A great recipe book for anyone who wants to impress their family, friends, co-workers  (or themselves!) with delicious desserts. There's a lot to like about it. Here are my five reasons for giving it five stars:

1) An excellent introduction to the whole process of cooking caramel for those who are new to this delicious endeavor. Dennis Waller describes all the necessary equipment and provides helpful tips in his easy-to-read and easy-to-follow introduction.

2) All recipes follow the same format - and that's excellent because it helps those of us who have not done much with caramel before figure out what the main steps are in ALL caramel recipes. The same format makes these recipes easy to follow, thus, there's less likelihood of messing up.

3) I love the idea of adding some variety to the recipes, and Dennis Waller provides suggestions and options of what to change and how to change it. Love the idea of using spiced rum and Kahlua instead of vanilla! I'll just have to make sure I don't test-taste too much of either while cooking.

4) An excellent variety of recipes for different occasions, from more traditional to experimental.  Pumpkin Spice Caramel (and its Apple Spice version) and Spiced Pumpkin Fudge sound perfect for fall celebrations. Pecan Praline Caramel and Grandma Stella's Caramel would be great for the holiday season. The ones I'd like to try first are Spicy Chocolate Caramel made with Cayenne and Paprika peppers, Amaretto Almond Caramel, Bourbon Chocolate Pecan Caramel, and Chocolate Mint Fudge.

5) Pecan Pralines made with dried fruit deserve their own star!  Who wouldn't want to have dried mango, papaya, dates,  shredded coconut, or pineapple in their dessert. That will make it healthy, too. The five food groups, lots of fruit, and all that, right?"

For three agonizing months he's been drowning in fear and sorrow over his brother's plight yet having to put on his princely face and perform his princely duty. He's just about reached his breaking point when Savvy stumbles, lierally, into his life. She goes from saving him from a handsy title seeking woman and her daughter to saving his sanity. Savannah Breslin has ""been there, done a prince before"" routine and it broke her heart. She wants to protect her heart but being with His Royal Hotness breaks down her defenses. In turn Savvy becomes his anchor in the tumultuous storm of his brother's disappearance.  Duty keeps calling Kian away and his brother is finally rescued it seems he's pulled away from her more. Even though he's told her he loves her, she believes that they will never have a future because she is an American commoner. So she runs away to protect herself and deal with her breaking heart. Kian finds her and declares his love again backing it up with proposing. It seems this time she will get her prince and her happily ever after.

Tracy Wolff did a great job in combining two storylines: the hot and heavy romance of Kian and Savvy and Kian's journey through the kidnapping and rescue of Garrett. As Kian experiences the angst, anger, rage and impotence of not being able to find his twin, the reader experiences the poer of those feelings right along with him. The sizzle between Savvy and Kian is palpable and practically leaps of the page. I thoroughly enjoyed this romance and am looking forwarx to reading Garrett's story.."

Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"The best part about the 3rd installment of the IMA series is that it looks like it's not going to be a trilogy! The ending definitely sets things up for a continuation and that means more of my favorite fictional couple!

Locked and Loaded picks up exactly where Armed & Dangerous left off; right in the middle of Michael and Christina's first fully consensual moment of intimacy. It's nice to see the development in their relationship. Christina is still growing into her sexuality and sorting out her feelings for Michael. Michael is feeling somewhat vulnerable having confessed his love and now believing that Christina ""has him right where she wants him"" which makes him somewhat defensive. Or as Christina describes him ""Michael was like a half-tamed dog, as likely to turn on you as he was to snuggle up against you and lick your face, and just as slow to trust"". Their relationship isn't easy, but it is realistic and the characterization as usual is spot on. It is gratifying to see the emotion and trust grow between them; and Michael's sharing of his sexual fetish says as much about their individual growth as it is simply. rather titillating. The story is equally divided between relationship building and plot, suspense and intrigue. Christina finds that her plan of joining the BN to be trained as a hacker doesn't work out exactly as she had anticipated; and Michael still has the IMA and the psychotically evil Callaghan to contend with. The story ends on a Happily for now note. My only complaint is that it was too short. I want more excitement, more intrigue, more wonderfully enjoyable dialogue and more realistically portrayed emotional growth from my 2 all time favorite characters. (More hot sex and detailed fetish exploration would not be remiss either."
Kindle_Store_5,4,OR,"Ive decided to retire to Marietta and get a permanent ringside seat to all the excitement that seems to grace this little enchanting town. Bachelor auctions, hot cowboys, unsuspecting love weaving magic, and the essence of romance filling the air is just perfect, as these potpourri of authors create love stories around these wonderful people.

The second book in the Montana Born Brides brings out His Blushing Bride Piper Tierney even as Sebastian Bloom wants to fight his feelings for her. On a break from his doctorate program, Bastian comes to Marietta to attend his sisters wedding and ends up falling head over heals for the shy and blushing Piper.

Taking over from her father, Piper is the music teacher in Marietta High. Born with a birthmark on her face and having endured childhood teasing and bullying, Piper maybe a successful and beautiful, but her history with the opposite sex has a lot of learning to be done. And Sebastian charms her pants off and they fall into an affair that is supposed to be temporary or can Bastian convince Piper into becoming the next Marietta bride?

Dani Collins writes some really sweet love stories. I loved the fact that she gave her heroine a flaw that could happen to anyone. I admire the way she made Piper into this strong and independent woman, yet vulnerable and sensitive, wanting to be loved for who she is, a beauty inside out. And this beautiful lady sends Bastian into an emotional roller coaster as he tries to fathom his feeling for Piper and convince her of his love being genuine and permanent.

Another charming romance in the town of Marietta, and its always so very wonderful to revisit characters from the previous stories.

Kindle_Store_5,4,OR,"Eve Fortescue is back in Bellefleur, Lousisanna in hopes to convince Brent Bellefleur, groom-to-be, that she is the one he should marry ~ not Honey Moreau.  As a guest of the upcoming nuptials, Eve also has the uncomfortable pleasure of attending the pre-wedding dinner being held at the Bellefleur Country Club.  Here is where Eve is going to strike while the iron is still hot.  As she enters the country club, she latches onto the first unpaired male she can find and requests him as her date.  And she walks right into the web of Brent's cousin, Rainer Delacroix.  He makes her an offer she doesn't refuse and her seduction of the groom-to-be takes a different turn in the road.

Eve Met Her Match has a wickedly seductive kissing scene that leaves the reader breathless right along with the characters involved.  There are also some very swoon-worthy actions that make reading this short novella quite enjoyable.  The descriptions of each scene were adequate and well-written.  They don't bog down the story with useless details or babble.

At first, there is a bit of disdain for Eve.  I mean, she's only coming to the wedding to try and steal the groom away from a woman Eve used to call her friend.  Many of the secondary characters (guests that also attend the pre-wedding dinner) have no trouble seeing through Eve's charade.  It's perfectly clear what Eve's intentions are that evening.  Fortunately, she lands in the lap of Rainer, who does a sexy wicked job of seducing Eve and getting her to open her eyes and really take a look around.

This novella is sweet, sexy, and wickedly fun.

Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"Couldnt put this one down from start to finish! From page one Ms. Marcus kept me intrigued in this beautiful romance that was just fitting for two strong and independent characters. My favorite, though, just had to be Rory McRoy. He was just such a sweetheart of a guy! Theres nothing that he wouldnt do to protect and support his woman. And, Neve James has all that and more when it comes to her relationship with Rory. Yes, there were some pretty heavy misunderstandings between the two, but as they work them all out, just what exactly is their connection? What does a relationship with Rory really mean to Neve? And, is she in it for the long haul? In other words, can she trust him?

This starts off as a pen pal exchange of letters as Rory is overseas on military assignment. Their friendship develops into something more as the two correspond and then finally meet. But, when Rory is caught in what seems to be a lie while Neve jumps to the wrong conclusions, their relationship suffers until Rory helps Neve see the good in him and learns to trust him again. Ahhh, the romance, which is sweet and sensual. The drama, which is conflicting and emotional. The suspense, which brings truth and understanding when everything is now out in the open. Its a story that is tenderly touching when dealing with sad but yet truly genuine concerns. The dancer and the soldier  two people wanting to find that everlasting love that they can trust in. Whos to say that they didn't find it in each other? This one is worth taking a chance on!!! Ms. Marcus again writes romance at its finest...

What a fun love story this is!! Thinking her ""love"" life is done and over, Jordon isn't ready for her reaction to Blake. Upon meeting him she is rude and outright mean to him. It will take a stronger man to keep coming back to a girl for all intent and purposes beyond crazy. Blake sees something in Jordan and vows that he will get her for himself.
Of course I so fell in love with Blake. The way he handles Jordan is amazing, He doesn't let her run away. She gets so busy fighting her past shadows she misses the fact that she is falling for Blake. All the back peddling she continues to do, Blake just seems to stay close to her. Jordan strength is in that she has moved on from her pain to become who she is. Blake even his background doesnt define who he is. Giving Jordan the time she needs was prolly the biggest thing to help her over come her own demons.
The sex is soo shower worthy. (smiles) some had me even squirming. The first time they are together how he tells her to keep her eyes on him. He chased her shadows away. Opening her future and helping with her past, with patience and showing Jordon she isn't just a booty call.

Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"The second book in the Asylums for Magical Threats series is mesmerizing paranormal romance that takes the reader on an adventure.  Fighting to free elemental magic users, Camilla Melini is on a mission to find one of the legendary Four Talents. Marco Alvarez is sent to Mexico with two goals  to watch Cams back and to investigate a series of arson fires. Despite their differences they will have to work together to save their colleagues and to keep the Talent from falling into the wrong hands.

This steady to fast paced plot keeps readers hovering on the edge of anticipation with suspense, action, drama and romance.  The author uses well written scenes and events to inspire vivid images that capture the imagination.  Tension building anticipation and curiosity draw the reader deeper into this world of magic and mayhem and the strong compelling characters are easily related and grab the readers attention from the very beginning.

The attraction between Cam and Marco radiates from every page and the sex scenes are hot and steamy, but its the relationship that has magic and sparks flying off the pages and the two argue and test each other with snarky and humorous dialogue as well as some fight scenes. The bad guys in this series really inspire outrage and anger, only thing is there are so many plots and conflicts going on, the reader not really sure which ones are the bad guys, which of course keeps things real interesting.

The author gives us a great chance to catch up with all of your favorite couples from the previous two stories;  Ari/Riely, Athena/Denali and Daynesha/Cesar.

This book is as much about this cast of friends as it is learning more about Arden and what she needed most in her life.

Roam is that hot alpha male biker with a rough exterior but sweet softer side that he only shows to certain people. Lacey gets under his skin and their up and down relationship starts...and it blossoms into real love until some very devious plot twists and turns send her running away with his baby girl. I really liked this book even though it was a way more ""kindler, gentler"" version of a biker book than what I'm used to (more family and children around) and the sexual relationships were so steamy and heat inducing without being too sleazy (even a threesome!).
My biggest issue was the major skipping of time...chunks of elapsed time throughout the book was probably so the author could get farther faster and make this a complete standalone. BUT I also have an issue with books whose characters act without thinking things through and getting the ""WHOLE PICTURE"" before taking off. OMG...how many times did people not listen or not let someone finish a sentence before slamming the phone off and not finding out the truth before years pass!!
On the whole though, I enjoyed this book and would read more by this author as the story and characters were real and down to earth.

Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"I've always been a sucker for a bad boy who comes back to a town from his youth and tries to makes up for past mistakes! This is such a book. But I have to say I really felt a strong connection to the hero, Luke. I've read several of these types of stories before and liked the main characters but Luke has to be among my all-time favorites! He just seemed real and fallible and I loved how the author didn't make him too macho in the beginning or too sappy at the end! I loved his humility and his desire to ""do the right thing"" as situations arose even when other people in the community questioned his decisions. Luke comes back to town to be the interim sheriff and Holly cannot believe it! Luke almost destroyed her family, mostly her father, who is the current sheriff, when they were teenagers and she can't forgive Luke for that. Why is her father giving his job to Luke? Holly has so much on her plate, namely a young son who is getting in so much trouble, a father who she doesn't understand, a business that is stressing her out and she's a widow! Her town is falling apart and now Luke is back in town after a decade away - WHY???? Luke, on the other hand, was the child of the town drunk, and he knows people are not going to accept him until he shows them he's not like his father. There's a lot to do in Butterfly Harbor and he's going to do his best to help the struggling town but he's going to need Holly's help...if she'll just forgive him. I love this book and all the characters were fantastic! I can't wait for the next book in the series!"

Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"I received an ARC of this book in exchange for a honest review.

As American as apple pie! I have been getting into Sports romances here lately ever since I read Pucked By: Helena Hunting, while Rage does not have quite the comedic timing it is still an engrossing read. I love baseball, even grew up playing it myself with my friends so I have a soft spot for anything to do with the sport. AJ is the main character and while he's a bit of a hot head he's an awesome player both on the field and off if you catch my drift ;)

Until he hits the major leagues his temper has controlled his career but after a coach takes him under his wing and along the way he introduces  AJ to his granddaughter who is adorable! And leads to me changing my opinion of AJ, he's great with Clair and eventually meets her mother Addison. . . He makes a stellar first impression let me tell you! Acting like a Grade A . . . Well you know haha but he makes a huge turn around.

I really enjoyed this book, the characters were so well done and the author built up enough intrigue and tension between Addison and AJ that it made for a natural progression. Not like some where they meet and within the first couple of chapters they are falling into bed. I like that she was cautious of beginning a relationship because of Clair it made her a good momma which is one of my favorite character traits of hers. There are some twists and turns in this story that I didn't quite anticipate and that made me want to pick up everything Elizabeth writes from now on. I highly recommend this book for those who enjoy sports romances!"

Book title: Alpha Wolfs Pet 2, Kept
Page length: 171
Price at time: $2.99
Review:  I was first introduced to Eva Gordons work through her first book in this series, Alpha Wolfs Pet book 1, hidden. I loved book 1 and have been waiting for book 2. I read book two in one day. The characters and setting are well developed. You can visually see where things are taking place and why. This story will grab you right away and you will not want to put it down.  The story doesnt leave you with a cliffhanger, but leaves you wanting more. I will be looking forward to book three. (Please read book one first)

Overview: Mia has just with through a huge ordeal. She was exposed to the secret society of werewolfs. She now has to agree to sign a non-disclosure and have the option of being his pet girlfriend (since wolves cant marry humans). Knowing that she is hiding from the mob and Dominic has offered to keep her safe and love her, she decides to sign the contract. But soon realizes that she will be subjected to obey all wolf laws, which includes being submissive to the alpha and being low man on the totem pole with the other wolfs, and with the werewolf King coming soon for his dead sons body, she struggles more. Mia is whisked away so the werewolf King will not order Dominic to execute her. When the werewolf King comes, he is not happy about what has happened with his son, with Dominic and his pet, nor is he happy that Dominic has a Pet instead of a Mate. Will Dominic be able to help Mia and save her from the Russian mob and deal with the werewolf King?
  Review by: Kristy Dean  11/2014"
Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"I wasn't sure if I was going to like this or not - a mix of Tudor history and fantasy/magic? I was pleased to find that it was excellent, and I read it in two days!

The author clearly knows her subjects very well indeed, which always makes such a difference. The history itself is detailed and accurate, and I very much liked the accounts of the day to day domestic life of the period. I'm fascinated by the thought of possible alternative lives, and the idea of what might have happened had Henry VIII believed his wife Anne Boleyn over the accusations of her enemies is an intriguing one. Of course all events have a butterfly's wing effect, and Ms Taylor imagined the fates of other members of the Tudor court very cleverly. The politics of the day are very well described, too; how quickly, in those dangerous and turbulent times, one could fall from favour...

I am not usually one for magic/fantasy novels, but this element of the story was most convincing; it made me think of a more grown up and serious Hogwarts! I wonder how much of it was just the author's imagination and how much was taken from the beliefs and practices of the time; I imagine it's a combination of the two. I particularly liked the parts about numerology and the breaking of codes; oddly enough I was only watching a TV programme last night about the use of codes in secret communications during Elizabethan times, and Ms Taylor has all this spot on. To sum up, the fusing of history with fantasy is very successful, and I shall definitely be reading the next book in the series before too long. I think it would appeal to anyone interested in the Tudor period, and to those who enjoy reading believable fantasy."

Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"Choose Yourself & Love You More by Author Lucie Jones

If there is a genre of book that I can identify with...it is an inspirational one!  The Introduction to ""Choose Yourself & Love You More"" is excellent as it quickly addresses the real issue and the difficulties we encounter in learning to love ourselves. It also stresses the need for internal positive self-talk. For many people, it is not so simple to look in the mirror and love what they see and who they are. As stated by Author Lucie Jones, it is very true that ""learning to love yourself is the greatest love of all"".  I'll even go one step further...if you don't love yourself you will never learn to truly love others. Charity really does begin at home. Therefore, I totally agree with her suggestion to have a better look at ourselves and learn to truly value who we are...

From the very first page right to the last, I can clearly see what this talented author's goals are and why she decided to pen this little gem of a self-help booklet. To love ourselves is not a crime...it is a necessity in order to positively change our self-image and move forward. Yes...we all have flaws as mentioned, however, they should not decrease our self-worth and affect how we live our lives. As this motivational author stresses, the benefits of self-love will enhance our opportunities to have better relationships. If we stop beating ourselves up...we will attract people who add to our positive dynamic which will result in healthier relationships. Who could ask for anything more? Great suggestions are given to help us follow a new direction and turn our lives around. It is an excellent place to start!

Beau did not see the revenge coming but when it happened he was angry and wanted to find Lola.  He wanted to destroy her?  Lola played the final card which not only hurt Beau but herself as well.  While Lola has disappeared, Beau is intent on finding her.  He goes through all the motions of being angry, looking for revenge and ultimately looking at himself and realising the part he played in this game.  How shallow of a man he became because of his money.  He realises that he loves her and not because she turned him down but because she is his equal and she owns his soul.  Lola has hidden under the radar while doing a road trip.  The trip opened her eyes up to discover what her future may hold.  After looking back on everything that they had endured, she knows she still wants him.  With her unexpected news and the realisation that LA is home, she heads home.  Can Beau convince Lola that he wants her without the games?  Can Lola ever forgive him?  I must admit I was a bit disappointed in this book.  The story lacked a building climax and was lacking conflict. Nothing much happened and most of what did made reference to things that we had read in the previous books.  In my opinion, I felt like the author was struggling to conclude this book.  The ending was really a bit of blas and the dialogue was awkward.  The head hopping between the characters was confusing.  I was hoping for more of a dramatic ending.  Overall the series was good but I did feel a bit let down by the ending..

Kindle_Store_5,3,OR,"Funny, but I don't recall the other book leaving out this much information, but then again it was this time last year that I was reading it so maybe my memory's not so fresh. This book is good, but one thing that threw me off was the passage of time; there was no indication of it. ""2 weeks later"" ""6 months later"" these are only 3 word phrases, it wouldn't take much to add them. But one minute it was Christmas, then after a separator in the middle of the page - which usually indicates a scene change - it's spring break, then next thing you know it's Thanksgiving. One of the reasons this is a problem is right before the page separator, Adam and JJ were saying they needed to discuss something important, and then after the separator, not only has it been discussed, but the process has been put in motion and they're almost completely done with it. No build-up or anything. This happened several times, which left me scratching my head and wondering ""well, what happened in between?"" I was glad that they were able to help provide a safe place for Thad, but what happened when they went to talk to his parents? Was there no argument or backlash at all? No obstacles in their way? And how did they decide to get legal guardianship? And why was the situation with Andrea helping out Adam and JJ handled like it was no big deal, just every day happenstance? And what happened with Grace Griffin? And this may be minor, but how on Earth did Thad get a new love interest before Adam's brother, Matt? Too many questions. However, these things are not guaranteed to keep me from reading more by this author, because his books have sweet story lines with very little angst."

Or, at least they are until some unnamed, faceless person decides to play with Nikki and Damien again, by emailing them pictures of Damien in the throes of passion with someone else. But this nameless, faceless faction doesn't stop there. This person then moves on to sending Jamie, Nikki's best friend, a video of her in the throes with her former neighbor Douglas, who, unbeknownst to all his many conquests, films their sexual escapades on his laptop. Clearly, his video bank had been breeched, because, as it has been stated many times, Douglas wouldn't be able to hack his way out of a paper bag, even with directions.
But this huge annoyance (which isn't solved, btw, which leads me to believe that there will be more Damien and Nikki), is overshadowed by the true heart of the story. Valentines Day. Ms. Kenner certainly has a way with writing romance, and I can only hope that my first Valentines Day as a married woman with a man who owns pretty much the entire world is as romantic as Nikki's was with Damien.
Their celebration starts a few days early with a scavenger hunt, taking Nikki back to all of the places she and Damien have been to and loved in the past. The end result is a three day weekend at a private resort in the Bahamas, before coming back home to a few more surprises.
Despite having a few guesses as to who is behind this blackmail scheme, this was a very, very romantic book. Heavy on the between the sheets (or lounge chair) action.
We also got to, briefly, meet Jackson Steele, who is the first character in the Stark Universe series, which is coming out Spring of 2015.

This is the Story of Black Betty(Bethany) a Dom at Dolls and Doms private mens club in Vegas and Alistair Ingram movie star.  Allistair meets Black Betty at his Bachelor Party at the exclusive club.  He leaves with a torn shirt and red marks on his chest.  Courtesy of Black Betty of course.  His Fiance Heather is not too happy about this turn of events.  Engagement broken and Black Betty thrown into the headlines as the other woman.  The only thing wrong with that is Black Betty has been hiding from her ex.  Now she needs to get away before she is found.

  Now it seems to me that Black Betty(Bethany) has somewhat of a twisted past and she has been living as Black Betty to escape that.  Never confronting her fears or trusting anyone but herself.

Kiera is an emotionally stunted woman. She doesn't seem to know her worth & impresses her skewed view on those closest to her. Her best friend Kevin is admittedly in love with her, but demonstrates a lot of hate for her as well. It's as if his devotion has been one sided for so long it's become bitter. At the beginning, Kiera's relationship with Jimmy, a man she feels she belongs with, ends & her self-imposed spiral into depression takes a drastic turn when she has sex with Kevin. It's not hearts & flowers, you're the love of my life kind of sex. More like angry, you can get the hell out of my life kind of sex. This only proves to confuse an already confused Keira. This story centers around a woman trying to grab her bearings. Everything that she thought was real is being stripped away. She no longer has Jimmy, her man, or Kevin, her sounding board; her cupcake business is in ruins. Her life at the end of her twenties isn't turning out so great. Without giving too much away, this story has me on the fence. I liked it, and yet I found myself not really enjoying the heroine.

There is nothing I can say that can top saying this was anther well written captivating novel about Mike Black by this author.

Kindle_Store_5,3,OR,"I thought I would give this author and series a go with this book.  I have to say I was surprised that my attention was caught from the get go.

It was very interesting to see how Dominic spent the last 200 years buried at sea.  When he was 'resurrected' he was thrown into the future and struggled to catch up.  His friend Palo took him in and began teaching Dom how to survive in the new world he found himself in.

A few thing bugged me about this story.  The grammatical errors.  When Dom accused Palo as a 'trader'.  I think the word should have been 'traitor'.  So little things like that distracted me from the story a bit.

The author glossed over the transition period for Dom.  I felt that the book could have been much more detailed and the author could have had fun with Dom's struggle with the 21st century.  I realise the focus for Dom is revenge, but the writing could have been meatier and richer if the story went into a little more depth.

The sex described seemed to skip a few steps.  I won't go into detail in case there are under 18's reading, but there was no writing direction, the reader has to assume what happens and where the positions of the characters are.  There were instances where I had to re read passages to see if I missed some things.

In the synopsis Dominic is intrigued by a lady biker.  The only lady he showed an interest in was a mechanical bull rider at a bar he nearly got tossed out of!  So I wonder where and whom this lady is , cause I didn't meet her!

But it was a good start and I am definitely curious enough to get the second book!"

For years she had worked alongside her father to keep the ranch running smoothly and it has been her home and her life. She also discovers letters to her and her sisters from her late mother that bring news that change their worlds. While Callan fights to regain some amount of control over her life, Court lends his not only his supportive hands but also makes a proposal that could give Callan some resemblance of her old life.

I absolutely loved the characters, especially that of Callan and her sisters. They share such a cool bond and are really close and understanding. Callan emerges as this strong girl who is used to running a ranch and confident that she can continue to do so on her own after her fathers death. At the same time she has this feminine quality about her that is really attractive. Court on the other hand, at first at least, feels a little bit of an outsider. He is handsome and sexy and understanding. However, I really did not get their relationship. There wasn't much interaction between them, let alone courtship yet they end up in each others arm. For me it was like two strangers professing their love for each other.

The plot had some twists which were a welcome change from the usual romance novels. Courts background and Callans mothers letters provided some additional depth to the book. However, the letters written by Callans mother felt too clinical in nature and lacked the warmth of a mother. The letters read like appointment letters rather than a letter from a mother to her children, especially with the news it delivers, one would expect some emotional words.

C.J Carmichael is one of my favourite romance authors, but this book disappointed me a lot."

I liked the characters, but I didn't like the way the story ended. I wanted to know if it was okay with the author or not. I was a little disappointed that the ending ended, but not that I was expecting. I thought the author was a good writer, but not a great author. I liked the idea of the book, but didn't like it.I am always a little skeptical of how this book will play out in the future.  I loved it, but it took a little while to get into it.

This was my first time reading the author's work and it was my first time reading the series.  I had a lot of fun with the characters and the storyline.  This was a good book and I enjoyed it a lot.  I would recommend this book to others.  I was given an ARC in exchange for an honest review.I liked this book so much I could not put it down! I love the characters and the story line! It's very realistic! I want to see more of the old school soldiers, but I'm not sure I want to read a story about a man who is so broken and confused that he doesn't know who to trust or care for. I love the fact that the author does not give the reader a definitive answer for what caused her to be so broken and confused. I look forward to reading more books by this author!

I received this book as a gift from the author.This is the first book I've read by this author and I'm glad I did.  She's done it again.  The story line is fast paced and flows very well.

Kindle_Store_5,4,OR,"I like Amazon/Warrior Women stories a lot. There doesn't need to be much plot to them for me to devour them. Having said that, and the fact that it was awhile ago that I read this, I really enjoyed the story. I had read some reviews voicing concerns about events taking place in the book, but considering the time these events took place (alternate reality, as it were,) this didn't bother me. I'm just reviewing this now, because I still remember things in the story; it's thread still excites me. I have it in my ""to read again pile,"" which says a lot. I will also say that even though this is a Book One in a trilogy, this book stands on its own nicely. In fact, I really have no desire to finished this trilogy. I previewed the other two books and they don't hook me like this first book did. Unlike other trilogies I've read, there is no cliffhanger, that I recall. Overall, a rather enjoyable, (albeit long,) story. I don't normally read nearly 600 page stories. Aside: I don't care one whit about this author's gender issues. misrepresentations or not. We all have our gender discoveries to make, many take a lifetime to resolve. Far be it from me to judge from afar without walking in someone else's shoes. I buy books that I like for content. I don't care if it's a ghostwriter, a straight man writing as a lesbian, a f2m, m2f, transgender. Or any other gender I missed. Reviews should be about books, and author's style; they should not be direct attacks on said author's person. And full disclosure: I was born a woman; and, yes, I am a lesbian. I do not read most books mainly for the sexy bits. I absolutely believe you can be straight and write good gay/lesbian dialog. Love and emotions are universal."
Kindle_Store_5,4,OR,"Well.....what a story! It is so hard to review without saying too much, so I will try.

I went into it kind of blind, wondering what it was about as i loved the cover and title and just wanted to read it.

Having been through so much so young, Lacey let it all go one night and did something she had never done before...slept with a man, drop dead gorgeous, instant attraction off the charts met in the club Caine. I mean sh^t it was melting how they were almost at it on the dance floor.

What a charming wonderful guy Caine was...romantic, caring, singing to her in front of everyone, melted my heart...a perfect gentlemen, opening car doors, a little possessive, but that is because he loves her right?

....he has an alcoholic mom and a troubled past and when events in life take a surprising twist....she agrees to marry him, even after a hiccup in their relationship...after visiting the courthouse, he stops opening the car door! Where did the gentleman go? My Heart Sank.

That was it..after reading along happily i was suddenly stopped dead......wow! You think you have been got with
what is coming next....no, you haven't!!

I loved the relationship between Lacey and Becca, i was laughing out loud during their conversations and in the hospital during the quiz i was freaking screaming! (You will know when you read it)

From 'The Pussy Doctor'....to 'Aunt Flo visiting', to the Smurf scene, i could barely breathe and this was such light relief after i had been through the drainer living through Lacey's life.

I hate to think what Lacey would have done without her friends and family.

I wanted Becca's con's list carved into his back with a rusty knife.......i think Becca would have done it.

The ending was something else, one thing.....then another, all wrapped up teetering over the edge of a sharp dark cliff edge!

Bring on the next enstallment!"

The story is pretty cute, but not the perfect story for a younger adult. There are some things that I would like to see in this story. For example, if you are looking for a cute story with a good story line, this is a good one. Also, if you are looking for a story that isn't filled with a lot of angst, this is a good story.

His new trainee is Aled Price another person with human genetics and stubborn streak a mile wide.  Kai and Aled butt heads from the very beginning, but realize that they need each other to survive.  They have to deal with the harsh realities of training, and when that is over, the treatment at the hands of the Ungrich.

Aled realizes that Kai doesnt believe he deserves better than being taken roughly and without any choices in how he is taken, but trying to make Kai see that he deserves more may be battle too big for Aled.  We see Anna and Rehz in this book as well since the Ungrich seem to have set their sights on human DNA.

When Aled goes in to get his medical clearance and to finally be free to pursue a life with Kai, he is taken for the Ungrich, as is Anna.

But what we do have is a very well-written and engaging story about a young man's experiences as he becomes an intern at a large well-to-do church. In the hands of most writers I would have probably been bored to tears but Mr. Moody creates a fun and entertaining look into the quirks and idiosyncrasies of your standard Baptist style evangelical church. As one who has spent many years in ministry I can say he hit the nail on the head. No matter where you are or what you are doing people are a trip.

If you're the type that likes easy going stories with no stress or books that won't keep you up too late at night I suggest getting yourself a copy.

If you're concerned about the book being preachy because of the topic you have nothing to fear. There is very little Biblical reference at all. It's more about the people and the inner workings of ministry in general. You'll laugh and be entertained. Even non-believers will enjoy this book. It was a nice stressless experience for me and I enjoyed it much more then expected. It'll make a nice seashore read for a lazy vacation.

Libbie comes from one of the most wealthy families in the town. Her family or at least her mother places her value on wealth to measure worth. Her sister was someone I really disliked, she was a real stirrer of the pot. Libbie's dad was good, if somewhat indulgent and with the penchant to look for a life of turning a blind eye to what was going on in his home.

Jack was a hard working young man, in love with Libbie but as their life progressed he could see all was not right with Libbie. (They married so young - as  many did in those days.) So when Jack's daughter discovers that he was married before the marriage to her own mother she is very curious as to what happened to Libbie. As the reader I was too, what did she do in the intervening years? How did this fragile, anxious but sweet young woman fare?

It is Emily - Jack's daughter who when she learns of Libbie in her father's life spends time searching for her.  It is a time for her too to re-evaluate how her own life is panning out and whether  the man she is with, is right for her.

The story comes eventually to a heartwarming and moving conclusion. I was amused at how well all the threads of the story were detailed out in the epilogue. It is rare that that happens!

The story examines mental illness and the lack of understanding in the past that led to much suffering. It is a story of second chances and growing into a place of contentment and self fulfilment."
Kindle_Store_5,4,OR,"I definitely had a love, hate relationship with this  book. When I began to read  the book I wasn't very impressed at all. I couldn't really figure out who was who and what the story was really about. So I decided that I needed to continue on in order  to give a fair review. I'm so glad I did. The author has written a very intricate mystery that  kept me guessing throughout the book. The action is explosive and at times very intense.

Jake is a former Marine who has  a keen sense of awareness of his surroundings. I thought his  character was good and had lots of depth. He is smart, decisive, alert and had great instincts. He has a new job as a photojournalist. While following someone he inadvertently stumbles upon an assassin  at large. The assassin does  not like lawyers .  Jake seems to get one step ahead and then takes two steps back in this lively story. Who is the assassin? Why are lawyers being targeted?

I thought the assassin  was a brilliant character because he was so unpredictable. He reminds me of a ticking time bomb. You never know when it will go off but you know when it does , chaos follows. I liked the multidimensional, quirky and very unnerving characteristics he had. What I really like was how the assassin even controlled the people who hired him. With cutting words he was in control and calculated his every move. He does some very ingenious things to divert the attention away from him and on to Jake. Will Jake be able to prove who the assassin is? I recommend this book to mystery lovers who like intrigue and characters that jump off the pages with intensity.

Belle's life was sheltered and controlled in every one of her 21 years growing up in Mexico with Damian. He loved her with all his heart and protected her to the point she could do nothing a normal teenager and young adult should have experienced at her age, he was frightened of anyone getting to her and using her as a bargaining chip or worse against his life and to take his control and power.

Lately, Bryce was having little control of his bear and his brothers were keeping a close eye on him. He knew that Alana was in Star Lake Forest and roaring went to meet her. He didn't trust her. With much effort Alana persuaded him that the source of the problems was the Hollow losing its magic. She told him that something was draining its magic and she was the only one who could fix it. But she was lying to Bryce. She needed Liz to help her because her powers had weakened. It wasn't easy to deal with Brandon, Liz mate. He was suspicious and harsh with Alana. He could not forget Alana nearly had Liz killed. But the Hollow was in much danger it. It was worse than what they thought.

They would have to fight him because without the Hollows magic the Mitchells would die. In this third story we get to know all about the Mitchells curse. Why Alana cursed Bryce and his brothers as collateral damage? I was very curious about what happened ten years ago that split them apart. Alana cannot forget Bryce did to her and Bryce could not have the woman he wanted because what Alana did. Way to keep the mystery of the situation. The author kept me intrigued from the first book. The development of the story was very interesting with much suspense, drama, action, and sex. Touching the scenes between Alana and Liz. Much feelings in there. This was the best of the three books of the Mitchells brothers. I knew it would be juicy. Love this stories.

I will admit that I have been tempted to buy an online game publisher for a while and then wonder if I could take it as a personal investment. However, in this case, it is very clear that this is not the case. The author's writing is descriptive and entertaining. There is a lot of action and suspense. I was quite surprised to see that the author is on a new series that involves a new character, Ms. Reeder, who is a former CIA operative, and who is also a journalist. There is a lot of depth and mystery that is evident from the characters' actions. It is interesting to see how Ms. Reeder, who has been in the military for a while, has become a journalist. The story is well written and the characters are well developed. The plot is well developed, the characters are well developed, and the story is well developed.

Her long brown hair is down, with a little bit of wave and it frames her face, making the perfect window. "" ~Courtney Pierce

Through the first two books comes together to bring in Court's POV and you will find out what happened between him and Annabella and things will come to light between Court and Rachel. Break Me ended in a small cliffy to start this book up with Rachel finding out she is pregnant. Is it Kellan's or someone's else?  No spoilers here so you will just have to see. I really loved this book and finding out more info on Ashley, Victor, Annabella and several unexpected twists to be revealed. Of course, you will have plenty of swoon worthy moments and angst to hold you over. Don't forget about the betrayal and enough steamy scenes to make up for it. I love this series! I reread them every time I have a chance to read the next book when it comes out!  Hope you enjoy!

Kindle_Store_5,3,OR,"It was a case of All or Nothing for me. The crux of story sold me even though there were parts I did not like. An aptly named series, Wicked Games play out in this book for Jena. Unwittingly playing a game she has no idea she is a participant in, it appears that by the end of the game she could lose everything. Character and story issues left me with mixed emotions. I liked King, but I did not like his original game plan and I had a hard time reconciling the man who went into the game with eyes wide open to the probable repercussions of what he put in play with the man who fought for his woman at the end. We also got just enough info on King and Wick to know they are not good guys, but not enough to know what exactly it is they do. At times, their actions did not match their words and this disturbed me greatly. Jena came across as dumb as a box of rocks, dismissing what was happening around her by resorting to excuses and sticking her head in the sand. She evoked frustration and sympathy simultaneously, but it was her weakness that lost me in the end. Timeline issues unsettled me as well, as in when did King and Wick meet? Was it in when they were kids or in the military? It cant be both in my head, yet both were stated as facts. A proper back story on those two would have improved this book immensely, probably cleared that issue up and added some character depth that was missing. A little more about Jenas old job would have been nice too. And after all that you're wondering why I said I liked it? It was all about the game for me and on that level it delivered to the point of me wanting Wicks story next. Spices Rating: 3."

Kindle_Store_5,3,OR,"Anyone familiar with the Desire, Oklahoma series will recognize the cast of characters in this story -- including Dillon and Ryder. The newest addition to the town comes in the form of Alison (Ally as affectionately referred to by Ryder). Alison comes to Desire on the heels of a bad breakup from an abusive boyfriend. Similar to all the other stories in the series, Dillon and Ryder come swooping into her life completing ensconcing themselves in it while overwhelming her with their (neanderthalithic) overbearing ways and masculinity.

The story prattled along at a lumbering pace, IMHO, as Alison whined about things being ""none of your (Dillion and Ryder's) business"" (said 14 times) and spanking threats from the men (mentioned 33 times...yes...I counted). The story was highly repetitive...not only of itself but of the other stories in the series. Really the characters in these stories are interchangeable because the story lines are so consistent with one other. This series now has 8 books in it...and honestly, as a reader, I'm getting to the point where I don't care because there is nothing unique about them anymore. Desire for Three: Winning Back Jesse is actually about the characters in Desire for Three. *Scratches my head*....so now we're going back and revisiting characters? Pass!

Don't get me wrong, I enjoy Leah Brooke's work, I just want to see some originality come into play in her stories. As they are now...they are just meh because of near exactness of the stories and characters -- resistant females...dominant men...and they all live happily ever after. I'd like to see her throw some different characters in a the mix. Send someone of a different nationality to Desire to find love. Send a couple looking to add to their triad.......give me something different to work with.

Raw Desire wasn't unenjoyable...I just though it could have been much better and different.

This was a really good read. Yes its shorter but this book wasn't rushed and I really, really enjoyed it. When I first read the book description I thought of Kristen Ashley's book Golden Dynasty and while they have a similar idea this is a story all on it's own. Stian was a great hero and like all of Ms. Snows hero's he was possessive, and strong, and me man you woman. Agata was a great heroine she didn't melt under pressure and she wasn't stupid. I also liked that she wasn't so stubborn that she missed what was right in front of her. All in all this was a really great read that was fast, hot, and new."

I remember reading Mine to Lose where we were introduced to Trey. After everything that happened, I was hoping that he had his own story. This did not disappoint!

Trey is hurting because the girl he wanted belonged to someone else. He throws all his attention into his work. His younger brother Jett is back and is working with him. He and Trey go to a bar and Trey ends up drinking (which he doesnt do) and spends an amazing night with a stranger. Fast forward later and Trey is trying to get this account for his company, so he has to spend a few days with the owner and basically has to prove why his company is better that the company he previously worked for. That company sends a person to represent them and come to find out, its the girl Trey had that night with, Faith. From there sparks fly and the back and forth between them as they are trying to win the account is so good! They have a love/hate relationship but the attraction is there. talk about hot!

As you get more into the story, we learn more about Faith and who she is. You just want to take the two of them and lock them up so they can get their stuff together, but there are things that prevent it. you will enjoy this story and root for Trey and Faith all the way! Do they get together after everything that's happened? You have to read it to find out. Let me just say that Trey's brother Jett, was hilarious throughout this whole book. I can't wait for him to get his story :)

Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"WOWSER

I have read some truly remarkable horrible stories based on facts over my time but this one is truly dark, full of mental and physical anguish, abuse and RAW emotions its tangible. You can feel it oozing out from its pages. I am taking deep breathes here. Its somewhat written as a memoir, but in other parts reads like a novel. Except for the fact this was reality for the author. There are advisory notes from the author:
If you yourself are disturbed by abuse and any of the violent abusive events in this story, she says, do not read unless you can survive it or it can lead YOU down a dark path:

If you have been abused, the same applies

Its interesting to me that she has not written this for a therapy as most do or a story to be told. The mental state and dark places this author went to in writing this book is deeper than a very deep black hole. She says how the book has not been edited and re edited so as to take the meaning and exact happenings out of this true story. It is how it is. The woman that is broken and quite frankly mentally disturbed [and who wouldn't be by this] is different from the woman today. This is not written as a memoir it is written more like a novel. Do not think you can read this book for enjoyment, definitely not. Its a journey, its a learning curve, its a lesson. Anyone can take something away from this read. There is no way I can say its NOT distressing because it IS. The author admits, she was insane when she wrote this, as an advocate for mental awareness, I would say, she definitely was emotionally distressed, disturbed and needed mental health care to cope. Whichever way she managed to get all those pieces back together, my hat goes off to her as it would have been oh so easy to have departed in other ways."

I must back up and say that this is the first book by Erin Noelle I have read. Not bought. Read. Ive had a few of her books on my Kindle for a while and I have a few in paperback. I really could kick myself for not reading her books sooner. I mean really. I was totally missing out. I just went and one clicked two more.

The Perfect Life was perfect to me. A book that took over my life for the time I was reading it. I finished it in one day which is a rarity for me. I couldn't put it down. I was consumed by it and the characters.

Its the perfect story with the perfect characters and perfect writing. Its unique and creative and has something added to the plot I never would have thought of.  I literally felt this book in my chest. And no, Im not exaggerating. My heart raced, I felt anxious and I felt the intensity between 2 Oliver and Monroe. Their attraction and chemistry is unbelievable.

The characters are so lovable. They are broken and imperfect yet perfect. I want Oliver in my life. His quirkiness is beyond adorable. Hes fun and sweet and romantic and charming and I adore him.

The Perfect Life brings up some serious topics. Life isn't perfect. For anyone. What appears on the outside isn't always how things are behind closed doors. It also tackles some other real life issues which I won't get into as not to spoil it. But it does so with grace and tact. And mixed in with the heaviness are moments of tenderness and love, and wit and humor that will have you smiling and laughing.

I loved it. All of it. The Perfect Life is perfect!! You won't regret one clicking. I promise."
Kindle_Store_5,4,OR,"**3.5 stars**

I have a thing for time travel books. It started when I was a kid with A Wrinkle in Time and has continued throughout my adult life. I've read Outlander multiple times and practically hug it at night. I just find time travel love stories to unbearably romantic.

""Paradox Lost"" was a nicely done time travel story with some good romantic chemistry. I always enjoy Libby Drew's writing. She writes in a way that feels... easy. Her stories have a great flow to them and this one was no exception. I was hooked from the start and effortlessly got into the groove of the book.

I had a few problems with some of the finer details of the story. Reegan had a PhD in history and was supposed to know the time period of 2020 like the back of his hand. That is why it was irritating for me when he didn't know some pretty basic facts about the era that he was visiting. He kept trying to open things voice activation and bumbling through 21st century appliances. It felt odd to me that a time traveling historian wouldn't know when things were invented.

Also, I kept thinking that Reegan's speech would sound different from Saul's. If I think back over 100 years and I traveled to that era, I would stick out from the moment I opened my mouth. I kept waiting for them to comment on accent or speech usage or something like that.

I tend to think of all of these details when I read a time travel book and they become distracting for me when I find inconsistencies.

Despite my nit-picking, this book really did have a lot to offer. It had a decent amount of action, some nice sex scenes, and it kept my Kindle glued to my hand all day. A solid 3.5 star (aka between ""liked"" and ""really liked"") for me.

Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"This is the perfect story to read when you have a few hours free and you just want to dream away and relax for a little while. Stranded with the Scottish Earl is a sweet romance novella that has a handsome, Scottish lord and a stubborn English woman in it. It swept me away from the beginning and I really enjoyed it.

Miss Charlotte Warren is living the perfect life or at least she believes it is and she thought her father thought so too so shes a little surprised and hurt when she gets a letter from him telling her that he has found the perfect husband for her. In no way will she agree to marry this stranger!

Ewan Macrae, the Earl of Lyle is looking for a bride but he never thought that he would find her in a little village in the countryside but her father (who he met in London) made him curious enough to make Ewan decide to pay her a visit. But he never thought that a spring flood would leave them secluded from the outside world. Something that works in his favor because the woman that he meets isn't very welcoming. But he knows in his heart that shes the woman for him. So now he has a few days to convince Charlotte that marrying him wouldnt be a bad idea. That hes worth it and he will prove it in any way that he can.

I really loved the banter between Charlotte and Ewan and yes, everything did go fast but thats much in the case in novellas. And sometimes you just want that magic where one look makes someone fall in love. Where love is simple. No fear, no hesitation just the knowledge that that one person is the one for you.

The story is told from both POV's. Im really happy that the writer Anna Campbell gave this story an epilogue! It gave this story that something more."

Aftershock is a truly amazing read.  In my opinion this story is even better than Joy Ride.  You do get to catch up on what's happening with the hero and heroine of Joy Ride, Marc and Emma, as well as getting to know the other members of the band Lightnin' a bit better.  But you also get to meet Sydney Alexander, newly named promotions agent for the happening, new-on-the-scene band Lightnin' who is hot, sexy yet somewhat troubled by some past life experiences and the nasty, bitter aunt who raised her after the death of her parents.  You get to learn more about Rick Trajean, leader of the band, Lightnin' while savoring all the sweet, sexy details of how Syd and Rick fall for each other.  Then hold on to your hats because things get a little wild when the nasty villain enters the picture.  Let me tell you.  Desiree Holt writes THE BEST villains and she sure doesn't disappoint in this story.  You are going to love hating this villain.

Desiree Holt is one of my absolute favorite authors.  I love her writing style.  Her characters are always so real.  The story line is always sure, succinct and sure to grab your attention.  All this is true in Aftershock but she goes beyond the usual.  I felt like I was really backstage listening to Lightnin' perform during the concert and interacting with everyone after the concert while reading this book. I highly recommend this book for your reading pleasure.  Aftershock is most definitely an Off-the-Charts #1 winner!"

Kindle_Store_5,4,OR,"The Wedding Trap hit a bunch of sweet spots for me. It had a little suspense, a little steam, a heroine that was likable and it had humor. I love when a story makes me chuckle. There's nothing too slap-stick about the humor; it's mostly dry observations that the heroine makes about the absurdity of the situation in which she finds herself.

When attendees of Isobel's wedding aren't swallowing that Alex is Beth's boyfriend ""Charlie"", the rumors start swirling, much to Beth's mortification, that ""Charlie"" is really a gigolo she has hired to save face. Since Beth can't tell the truth about Alex being a CIA agent on a case, she has to roll with it.

EXCERPT:  ""Alex grinned. ""They all think I'm a prostitute, don't they?""

""Yep,"" she said. For some reason, Alex finding humor in the situation only darkened her mood further. It wasn't funny-it was disastrous. Spencer had gotten exactly what he wanted: she was a joke.

Given what had happened to her today, it shouldn't have mattered. But for some reason, it cut deep. She imagined what the epitaph on her gravestone would read.

Beth Bradley.

Liar. Sinner. John. ""

There were maybe some unrealistic moments in the plot as far as the CIA procedures go, but I don't know how they roll, so I don't really care. And this story takes place over the course of about 3 days or so and that's a short time to fall in love. But, again, I'm not reading romance for the realism. I would have liked an epilogue to find out how they settled into coupledom (I'm making up my own words, here). But there are two more books in the series and hopefully Beth and Alex will be mentioned so we can know how they fare.

This book is written in the 3rd person with both heroine and hero perspectives, it's unequal--there's more heroine than hero. I'd rate the steam at PG-13. There's a few scenes, but they aren't very explicit."

Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"For many years now, I've been a fan of the true crime genre; reading nothing but these nonfiction tales of the worst side of mankind. After a while, while still interested in the crimes, the forensics, and the inner workings of the justice system, a reader can easily reach a point where the crime in and of itself has no shock value.

That was not the case in my most recently read book: Pure Murder by Corey Mitchell.

In Pure Murder, Mitchell tells the gut-wrenching, absolutely sickening tale surrounding the deaths of two Houston, Texas teenager girls: Jennifer Ertman and Elizabeth Pena.

On what should have been a short walk home through on of Houston's city parks, these young girls had the bad fortune of meeting up with six of Texas' teenage lowlifes: Efrain Perez, Raul Villarreal, Peter Cantu, Joe Medellin, Venancio ""Yuni"" Medellin, Jr., and Sean O'Brien.

Simply because the young, innocent girls were in the wrong place at the wrong time when these scumbags were ""feeling their oats,"" they were tortured, raped, and murdered.

For the first time in a while, this true crime piece managed to enrage me as I could not hardly fantom that in a group of six people there was not one decent individual that could have, in some way, helped these young victims.

And, as an added bonus, especially in a time where illegal immigration is such a hot topic, the attempts by Joe Medellin to use his illegal immigrant status as a means to absolve the indictment against him was, to say the least, infuriating. He participates in the raping, mutilating and murder of two young girls and he expects that this country will allow him freedom on a technicality?! I could not even begin to understand the audacity of this pathetic, spineless child killer.

If you're up for a good read that evokes so many emotions you feel as though you are on an emotional rollercoaster, look no further than this newest release from Corey Mitchell."

Kindle_Store_5,4,OR,"Sports romance!! Woohoo!  A little different though since neither of them actually play! The quick of it...Okay so Jackson is a sports analyst and Leila...the new sideline sports reporter who's working under him. And oh the attraction and intrigue they have for each other! For the first time they've found someone who thinks like they do. It's numbers and stats and seeing how puzzles fit. One thing that won't fit? An office romance. *le sigh* And so a yummy battle of wills begins...

First up...Jackson. He's so yummy it's hard not to think naughty filthy things in his direction. Leila certainly had that trouble. And, well, he does too so double the fun for us! lol The connection between the two was great. I loved that they both have a thing for numbers and stats and think the same way.

Jackson's just flat out delicious. He's hot, sexy, at the top of his game, is a world class flirt and he's a good guy (sometimes he's a little too perfect) but he cares about people. I really loved the heroine too! She's a football junkie, a good person, hard worker and funny! I totally fell for her and her humor.

Their romance was slooooooow moving since they didn't want to risk her job at the network and whatnot but I loved that they became friends first and totally respected each other. But oh when it heated up! Oh, yeah! It seriously heated up. There were sweet and aw-worthy moments between them too that totally had me in a swoon. Oh, and he's got some growly alpha male in him too so it's not ALL sugary sweet...

Of course there was a little bit of relationship drama. I didn't totally buy into the reasoning behind it--it was a little shaky to me--but overall I was still on board.

*dreamy sigh* Jackson's Trust was a deliciously fluffy treat. A fun romance, wonderful friendships, humor, heat and plain ol likeable characters made for a delightful time."

Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"Jet, the 6th episode of Secret Confessions: Backstage  is the hottest of the series and one story Id like to see continued.  Jet is the real drive behind The Screaming Tuesdays, the real master of their music.  All the Tuesdays are talented in their own right, but Jet is the total package, even though his voice is his instrument on stage, he can play all instruments well (though he demurs about bagpipes).  He is obsessive about his notebook, where he keeps his works-in-progress, his thoughts and his secrets.  He has been wanting to get his hands (mouth, body) on Charlie since he first saw her on the first day of the US tour.

Charlie has been embedded with The Screaming Tuesdays since the beginning of the US tour.  A reporter looking for the in-depth true story about the band, the tour and the individual Tuesdays; she has kept her distance from all the members of the band and their support team.  She wants nothing to tarnish her reputation as a reporter and devalue her work.  She knows how quickly her reputation can be lost if she is linked to anyone she interviews.  She has been painfully aware of Jet from the first moment and has delayed his interview until the last.

The last day of the tour, the last night, after the last concert, Charlie is scheduled to do her in-depth interview with Jet.  Jet made a decision to avoid alcohol for the US tour; he states hes not an alcoholic and it is just a personal choice.  The Tuesdays have been betting against him, but the US tour is over and the betting pool is unclaimed.  Yanis brings Charlie to Jets suite just as hes about to shower off after the performance.  Jet doesnt want to do the interview with Charlie because hes unsure he can keep his hands off her.  Chicago is about to get hot!"

The whole town seemed to be pretty much excited except her. Her heart has been broken by her high school sweetheart, a relationship that ended in a disaster. The last thing she needs was to become star struck.

Until she crossed path with the sexy and charming Greg Moran who arrives in Dogwood together with the rest of the cast and crew of Bittersweet. They had this crazy connection together, but if Cathy was careful to get her emotions in tangle, Greg can be pretty much fickle minded. He can be all in, and then all of a sudden, he was nowhere in sight. He can be interested now, and then appear disinterested the next time. He had some secrets of his own, that I wanted to know. I would have loved it more if he gets his own POV. But I was stuck with Cathy, and her thoughts weren't that bad. There were a lot of bumps before their happy ever after  and there were times when youd just wanted to ask Greg if he really wants Cathy, or if both of them wanted this to work

There were times when I got frustrated with the hot-then-cold Greg  just about everything seems to be perfect, suddenly theyd be back to square one, but still I found this book romantic and endearing. I love Cathy, and her friend Max and Hal  they were a great bunch, and both of her friends are there to catch her every time she falls. Greg was hard to love, but you couldn't resist his charms, so please don't blame Cathy.

Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"Following in the footsteps of the first book in the series, Marine for Hire, this delightful story treats us to Mac and Kelli. Mac is a security expert, ex-military, who needs a fiancee quickly as cover in his negotiations for an arms deal that is about to go down. Kelli is his sister's best friend, someone he vaguely remembers as a cute pig-tailed girl, but who will do in a pinch. Imagine his surprise when this vivacious gorgeous woman (who unbeknownst to him has had a crush on him for years) shows up for duty. The question is whether Mac will let the temporary arrangement they have turn into something more. I loved this story! Kelli is such a fun character - feisty, flirty, full of life. She has loved Mac from afar for so long, and now has the perfect opportunity to seduce him into bed and hopefully ingrain herself a little bit into his heart. Mac is also wonderfully written as a strong, handsome confident man, stoic on the outside but holding in strong passions on the inside. He feels that it's his duty to protect those around him and getting involved with a woman is too distracting. But Kelli is such a delicious distraction that he is willing to let down his guard just a little - long enough for her to get into his bed, and maybe a little corner of his heart as well. The sexual attraction between them sizzles and the love scenes are steamy and well written. Along with the relationship plot however is some suspense and action as well as Mac's job takes them into dangerous territory. In addition moments of humour abound, making the reader laugh out loud many times at the crazy antics that ensue. Secondary characters play important roles in the plot as well, mostly Mac's family as the relationship between Mac and Kelli develops. This was a fun, steamy, heartwarming read with laughs, tears and all emotions in between."

Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"I received ""Whither Thou Goest, I will Go"" by Naomi Dathan for free from [...]  I picked this book for one reason:  some of it takes place in Kansas.  Since I am from Kansas, I usually read books with Kansas as the location since most authors do not find Kansas interesting enough to write about.  This is an incredibly good book.  I loved this.  It starts in St. Paul shortly after the Civil War with Seth, an army officer, and Jem, a spoiled daddy's girl.  Daddy calls all the shots in this marriage, including how to raise Charley, Jem and Seth's son.  He bought their house, gives Jem an allowance, hires their help, everything.  When her father gets caught with his hands in the Army's cookie jar, Seth and Jem must sell the house and move.  Seth decides they are going to Kansas.  He actually winds up in Nebraska because the house is across the state line.  They move and start a new life.  One that Seth thinks he will control and start to call the shots.  God has other plans.

Jem is a wonderful fictional character.  She is soooo dramatic and funny.  She cracks me up even when she is being horrible.  Against her will, she toughens up and matures into a valuable woman.  Her character alone is reason enough to hope for this book to be a series. The end will stun you.  The only thing I did not like was the format.  I hadn't read carefully enough to see that the format was for an i-pad.  I have a kindle.  I do have an android so I could read it that way and also online through [...]  The author sets up an account for you all you need to do is supply a password and read.

Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"I don't know why I chose this book as the first book of Cole McCade to read but I am so glad that I did. This book is not for the faint of heart. It has strong elements of abuse and was very dark at times but still beautifully written. Poetic, lyrical, yet dark and gritty, raw and full of emotion. Leigh is an amazing young woman. She is strong yet broken, fragile and dangerously damaged. There were times that it was hard to read because she felt that she deserved what had been done to her. So as you hear in so many instances of abuse she continued to be abused (we read in great detail much of the abuse) and yet we see her grow stronger as the book continues until she finally decides that she will no longer be the victim and to finally fight for what she knows she deserves. The beautiful Gabriel is also broken but he is broken because of his choices to not feel the pain that was inflicted upon him by war. Gabriel sees the brokenness in Leigh and yet from the first time he meets he, he is drawn to her. There were just so many elements of this story that kept me reading it and not the least of which is Cole's ability to draw you into an emotional level with each character in the story, feel their pain (I have since learned that he does this because he has experienced it) and finally experience the freedom of love. Even with the rawness and grittiness, Cole turned this story into one of beauty. It is also evident that Cole is a great lover of books because there are ALOT of references to books, both subtly and not but he weaves them into the story beautifully. Even his acknowledgements were touching. Cole is definitely an author I will be following and reading and could there possibly be another story in the Crow City, fingers crossed!!"

Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"IN Book one I was totally thrown at the end... I was so frustrated because it ended as a cliffhanger ..and if I have never said it enough times ..Smiling)...I truly DISLIKE cliffhangers... Having said that Ms Devereaux was kind enough to send me book 2 for a free read and review as I did the first book ..Book 2 ......IS AWESOME,Exciting,Raptourous(sp?) ... OH I could go on and on ...  but seriously book 2 really gets into the ""nitty gritty"" of the storyline ..guess you could say the bones of who Sophie and Marc really are .... and what transpires between them and the other characters of their lives...Her writing is beautifully and wonderfully done... Sophie and Marc's characters are so developed in this book that you understand them far better ..The plot holds you from page one ..just as in book 1 you have the suspense , mystery and a glimpse into some BDSM ...even tho the sex scenes were more detailed in my opinion they were still not Explicit sexual content.....but they were good :)
I only have a slight sign of negativity and it starts around chptr 12 / 13 and goes on for a few chptrs ..you kinda get aggravated at the wishy washy ways between the 2 characters and makes ya want to reach in the book and slap Sophie into Submission  yourself..but.
 Ms Devereaux  comes back with a kicker..
Even tho Sophie and Marc's story is still unfinished ..... book 3 & 4 of this series jumps into a completely  new set  of characters.from what I have been led to believe in reading the reviews of them I myself have not read them ...
For me this book ranks 5 stars and book 1 would have been 5 stars but I was frustrated at the ending cliffhanger ... this one wasn't quite so bad ...but alas you still have a cliffhanger at the end...

Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"This book is basically a continuous of book one. It pretty much picks up where book one ended. The only difference is there is more of Bran And Tyrone's point of view through out this book along with Lance and Tide.

In this book I was able to see that Lance and Tide where able to feel more comfortable in their relationship. I feel that theirs is more of a relationship and less based around the BDSM lifestyle. I feel like they practice parts of the BDSM lifestyle but they r definitely not 24/7. I feel like each day that passes Lance was more comfortable in his own skin and that Tide is really good for Lance because Lance feels like he has the freedom to be himself and enjoy his desires because Tide supports him in his choices. They really are a great couple in my opinion.

Tyrone and Bran have been together for a long time in what I would definitely say is a 24/7 Dom/Sub lifestyle. They know each other's wants and needs but I feel like they have gotten complacent in their relationship and do not realize they are not meeting each other's emotional needs any longer but instead only the physical needs. Don't get me wrong they are still a very much strong couple in my opinion but I feel like maybe they are too comfortable with each other and I believe that Brans tumor scare is exactly what they needed even though I wish I could have happened in a better way.

Bran and Tyrone have to reevaluate their relationship and make changes and I believe this is a very good thing we're their relationship is concerned and I have no doubt that hey will continue to be a very strong, loving couple in future books in this series.

I cannot wait till the next one comes out if their is a next one that is. I enjoyed getting to know these two couples and hope to read more about them in the future."
Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"Wow, this is one very intense read! I was so blown away by the emotional pull in this book. I have read other books that Alice has co-authored with and have always loved her work. I have to say I think she outdid herself on this one. So many times I didn't know if I wanted to laugh, cry or just slam the book down and run. When you meet Saga she is just skimming by. Shes worried about making rent and having food to eat. Doing her best to hold on to a job that is not enough to get ahead. When she is at her lowest point, so she thinks things went south in a hurry. When there is no other option she takes a job as an escort. This is where she comes to know Jackson Stone. He is a very rich man who is looking for someone different from who is usually spent his time with. He goes to his long time friend Victoria who runs an escort service. Victoria sends Saga (Meadow) to Jackson knowing she is just what Jackson wanted except for a few overlooked details. Saga tells her self after meeting Jackson that she will not fall for the attraction she feels for Jackson. He is just a job. Jackson pushes his attraction for Saga away by telling his self that she is just a warm body to enjoy when he feels the need to. You are going to want to bash these two heads in at times. At times you're going to love Jackson how caring he is but then he turns and says or does something that you just want to slap him for. Saga is strong, but like all women she has a breaking point and Jackson seems to find just the right buttons to push to break her when he feels like she is getting too close. These two draw you in and keep you wanting more. Im looking and hoping for more from these two."

Sean Whitcomb is up for a promotion at his law firm, the test is a dinner for the bosses with his partner to prove his family values. Sean could burn water, but his ex lover Isaiah is a world class chef, so he calls in a favor. Isaiah Waterston has never gotten over the betrayal he felt when Sean left him to pursue his career ten years ago. So when Sean asks him to pretend to be his lover for the weekend and cook a meal for the bosses, Isaiah is hesitant. He makes an assanine comment about topping Sean in exchange for his help, and immediately regrets it when Sean agrees.

Dinner is a huge success as is dessert which consist of Sean laid out naked on the dining room table for Isaiah&iexcl;s tasty treat. The two spend a whirlwind, sex filled weekend together and Sean is more than eager to make his pasts mistakes right. But Isaiah is not buying it and leaves while Sean sleeps and to add salt to the wound, he doesn&iexcl;t return his texts or calls. Can Sean convince Isaiah that he still loves him, he&iexcl;s changed and he&iexcl;d give up everything he&iexcl;s worked ten years to build for another chance with him? Or was one last hoorah all Isaiah was in this for?

I have a new found fascination with interracial M/M novels and novellas, and Dessert did not disappoint! A fast, fun read with some jaw dropping sticky sex on the table that involves bananas and ice cream. The story centers around the present situation with Sean trying to get his lover back, attempting to make up for past mistakes. But there&iexcl;s enough of the past and their individual current lives sprinkled in to add a little depth to the story. If you&iexcl;re looking for a quick read that ends with a cold shower, this is the book for you!

Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"The Gideon Affair

Gideon Shaw is the sexiest man in Hollywood,  every man wants to be him and every woman wants to do him.  He has a very successful career with endless opportunities but the only things that mean the world to him are his family and his best friend and personal assistant Paige Turner.  He has loved her for as long as he's known her but he can't cross that line.  He can't risk losing her friendship if anything goes wrong.  And let's face it, he's an actor in Hollywood, plenty can and will go wrong.

Paige Turner is a Cornell University graduate that could do anything she desires in the business world.  When she came to L.A., the last thing she would have imagined doing was working as a PA for an actor.  But this actor wasn't just anyone.  In fact, Paige had almost single handedly invented this persona and without her, Gideon Shaw would not be the box office phenomena he is today without her.  She loves him but she can't let him know.  She values her friendship too much to even think about allowing him to learn her true feelings about him.

And then fate stepped in and threw them both for a loop.  They had to decide if the disasters that can only happen in Hollywood would destroy them or if they would come together and find a way to turn their friendship into something so much more than either of them was willing to admit could be possible.

Suzanne Halliday's story takes you through the challenges of a young couple that share love for one another but do not know how to tell each other how they feel without losing what they have and each other.  You will see how sex, drugs and the debauchery of Hollywood can affect a blooming relationship.  You will feel a variety of emotions reading this story but I promise you, you will enjoy every minute of it!"

I would recommend it.I really enjoyed this book. The first book was a great read. I read it in one sitting and couldn't put it down. I liked the characters, the story, the setting and the characters. I loved the way the story went on. I loved the characters, the story, the characters. I liked how the author took a story from the beginning to the end.

I've read all of the 3 books in this series, and I have no problem recommending this series to anyone who is looking for a well written, well-paced, and well-written read.  I'm not going to say anything about the other books in this series, but I'll tell you this:  The last book was a bit of a shock, and I was very disappointed.  The other books were very good, but the story was lacking.  The main character, Daisy, is a very good-looking, sweet, determined, independent woman who had a hard time with her mother.  She's a sweetheart and a strong woman, but she's also a great friend.  She's also a beautiful, determined woman, but her heart is a bit broken.

Kindle_Store_5,5,CG,"Amazing book! I'm looking forward to more books by this author.

Thanks for the opportunity to read this book.  The author, Danielle Hutton, is a wonderful writer.I enjoyed this book.  It was good, but it had some issues with the story.  The first one was a bit predictable, the second one was a bit more interesting.  I really liked the first book, but I felt like there was too much emotion.  It's very hard to tell if a book is about a romance or a serial.  This one was a bit more of a romance/serial and a little more of a story.  I can't say enough about the characters.  I would definitely recommend this to my friends.  I can't wait to see what happens next.I have read many of the author's other books and have never found myself wanting to read more of them.

I think I will read it again and again.  I didn't like the writing"
Kindle_Store_5,2,OR,"I am assuming that if you are reading this review you have at least read the synopsis of the book and know what the story is about so instead of summarizing I am going to list the things I did and did not like.

The good:

-The characters are great. They are charming and funny and I love that they focus so much on  family obligation

-The authors paint a wonderful picture of small town life

-There is a mixture of humor and more serious things going on within the story.

The not so good:

-There are a lot of spelling and grammar mistakes. A lot of mixed up he/she. There were also times that words were used in an unrealistic way. I don't think any woman has ever thought that she would like to feel a mans cock against her integument, though that is just my opinion.

-There was tons of unnecessary details given. I don't need to know that he turned the shower on, then checked the temp, then got in, then picked out a shampoo, then picked out a body wash and on and on it goes. The story could have been cut in half without losing anything of importance.

-pov jumped around a lot which is usually good but there was no real flow to it.

-There was just too much going on. The focus should have been primarily on Quinn and Mhisery with Chance getting his own book. The little glimpses of other people seemed out of place as well.

-It often felt like rather than reading a story things were being ""explained"" and there was too much repetition and even some inconsistency. He goes down on her at one point and then later is surprised that she is pierced there?

All of these distractions led to me not being able to enjoy the story even though I really wanted to, especially as this book was given to me in exchange for an honest review. I would really like to try another book by these authors though because there were things I really enjoyed."
Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"I have had to honor of receiving this book from the author for an honest review.  With Every Heartbeat was such a sweet story. I immediately fell in love with Annalise and Raphael!
  Annalise ate, sleep, and breathed to dance. Ballet is her life, every since her mother put her in her first pair of ballet slippers, she could not focus on anything else. Her mom had been a dancer, and she was following in her footsteps.
  Going to Rome with the American Ballet Company was an honor. Fighting for prime solo spots, training hard, and focusing on nothing else. Until she walked away from the group on afternoon that is.... Stumbling across a group of street dancers may have changed her life for good.
  One look at Raphael and she knew she was in trouble. There was something about the way he danced, so free, so alive... and those eyes!! Although she knew it was wrong, that she was risking everything, she continued to sneak away to meet him, just to melt in those eyes, in those strong arms.
  Agreeing to dance with Raphael she had to train her body to move differently. Years and years of ballet dancing could not have prepared her to be able to dance with a partner like him. She is falling in love, and she can't stop herself.
  After finding Raphael dancing with his old partner, Annalise is undeniably heartbroken. Not giving him a chance to explain, she runs. Beats herself over and over for being so naive and stupidly denying the training she needs for her once in a lifetime performance.
  The story of Annalise and Raphael is heart gripping. I loved reading how their story played out and how their love for music was engrained in every step they took in life. The book did remind me a lot of a movie I've seen... American girl meets hot young Italian, who sweeps her off her feet! How can you go wrong!? SWOON!

Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"The Glimpsing is an intriguing and haunting tale of revenge, love, hope, faith, courage, and the age-old battle of good vs. evil.

The author creates a very Twilight Zone atmosphere from the beginning of the book, with nods to Alfred Hitchcock, Rod Serling and Stephen King. Although I wouldn't classify it as a horror story, it incorporates the psychological horror and suspense for which the above three are recognized as masters.

Portia Childress, brought up by a mother who has the ability to ""glimpse"", see into the world just beyond our world, wants the one thing she can't find in her relationships with men: true love. How she deals with this unfulfilled need is the center of this tale.
The mysterious painting reminds me of aspects of ""The Picture of Dorian Gray"" and subsequent stories involving mysterious, ""changing"" paintings but this has its own unique flavor.

It is easy to identify with Portia's innocence and need but more difficult to understand where she went as result of it. Gabrielle, in spite of her own love for Jack, tries to remain loyal to Portia and to love her best friend. Jack's increasing feelings for Gabrielle only complicate the situation, bringing about some of the ensuing horrors.

My favorite character in this story, though a minor one was Jack's housekeeper, Janice. She has the wisdom to get an idea of what is going on after Jack first receives the mysterious painting, offers Gabrielle a way of dealing with her own guilt and ultimately is willing to risk dealing with something she is worried is beyond her ability to handle, because of her belief in doing the right thing.

This was a refreshing read, standing out among the current ""horror"" stories that I have read with its unique presentation of that battle between good and evil. Well worth the time invested in reading the book. Unfortunately because it would give away spoilers, I can't go into the details of the unique perspective presented in this story, but I think any fan of the horror/supernatural realm would enjoy the book"

Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"Wow Allie Juliette Mousseau has done an amazing job again. This book can be read as a stand-alone! At times this book brought me to my knees because I could feel the pain of Liam and Quinn. These two have been dealt a s*** hand. The book does flip from past to present a little more than my liking but you do need the back history for their story to make sense.

Quinn is a kid that has a mother who doesn't want her, she throws her out at 15. She has to learn how to survive on the streets. Being a 15 year old young lady on the streets is dangerous. And living in the wrong part of town you only have a few options in survival, drugs to numb the pain or selling yourself to devil to have some money. She makes her choice and it is neither. She meets Liam and he is living the same life. No parents, the abuse can be to much when you go from foster home to foster home. Liam learns to fight to survive. And when he meets Quinn he fights enough for both of them. That is so much for anyone to handle but they both do they best they can with what they have. Now go forward 10 years, their demons are still with them. They carry them everyday but Quinn did what anyone at young age would do when her world crashes, she ran as far away as possible leaving Liam behind. Liam did what he did and does best he fights. MMA fighting. But what brings Quinn home brings them face to face again. The question is, is it to little to late or will they save each other once and for all?

Kindle_Store_5,3,OR,"I didn't have very high expectations for this book. The combination of teen romance and historical fiction made me nervous that I would be cringing the whole way through. Fortunately, the author did her research and the result is a fairly accurate portrayal of life in a convent in Renaissance Italy, with a splash of magical realism. The romance elements don't really kick in until the halfway mark, leaving most of the book to focus on other aspects of the protagonist's life, what romance there is isn't overbearing or unrealistic. A plot twist 3/4 through helps keep things fresh with an unexpected change of setting for the final act. The book is largely well-written, but there are some poor descriptive techniques scattered about (""as cold as January"" was a particularly bland simile that stuck in my mind).

Where the book disappoints is in the drama. Most elements of the plot had me wondering why these characters care even half as much as they apparently do. The protagonist is a 17-year-old illegitimate daughter of a recently-deceased nobleman who's been sent by her step-mother to live in a convent. This is problematic for our hero because the only thing she wants on this world is to find a man to marry. A more charitable reviewer would say that she's realistically very focused given the options for those in her situation, but her one-track-mind struck me as obsessive and overly dramatic. The aforementioned plot twist is fairly transparent (if you're expecting a twist), and the while the MacGuffin around which the twist is centered may be historically accurate in terms of its importance, it seemed fairly trivial to me and fed into the overall feeling of unnecessary drama.

The protagonist's personal conflicts are sure to resonate with many readers, particularly girls around her age and younger. Readers who have an interest in art, particularly painting, might understand the drama better, and will definitely appreciate the author's descriptions of the art and architecture. The ending could be interpreted as slightly preachy, but it doesn't detract from the book."

Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"This is definitely my kind of book. It has everything that makes a really good thriller/adventure/military read. I loved the added mythology angle that was backed up by real sites. The science angle was believable and a the human experimentation added to the spine tingling parts. The action starts with the first page and you hardly have time to breath between pages. Robinson takes the reader on a rocket ride of adventure, treachery, treason and death. Each of his characters has special talents. Melding them into a fighting team is King's (Jack) job. In this story you get a lot of background about each team member. How and why the ""Chess Team"" was formed. Why Jack chose each name. Where Stan got his Desert Eagles. The first time Jack and Zelda met and what happened. How he won her respect and the rest of the teams. The bonds they formed with each other to become the fighting unit they are. Their first mission is to rescue a scientist who can translate an ancient manuscript. She has been kidnapped by unknown persons. The Chess Team follows the bad guys from Afghanistan to Iran and finally to France. They fight the Chinese tong, mutated humans, and unspeakable horrors. Finally in France they face the end of all life and maybe, the end of the planet. This is my first book by Robinson but not my last. I have already got his other Chess Team books on my ""to get"" list. I wish they were all audio books narrated by Jeffery Kafer. He has a very pleasing voice and gives life to the characters. He gets the dialogue between the team just perfect. Sometimes too perfect. LOL. The production of the audio was perfect. No static, dead spots, or skips. Everything was professional and well recorded. If you have read any of Jeremy Robinson Chess Team books you HAVE to read this one. The start of it all. Audiobook provided for review by the narrator.

Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"This standalone conclusion to the Norseton Wolves series is one of my favorites. Holley Trent has a gift of getting inside her character's heads and succinctly communicating their emotions, fears, hopes and desires to the reader. I don't know of any other author who can lay a character open with such understanding and yet do it with humor and compassion.  She is one of my top five authors, in part for that reason. I highly recommend this book and the series, which can standalone individually, as well as from it's companion Afotama Legacy series.

Arnold has only been in Norseton a few days when he has a vision that takes him to the Roosevelt Forest in Colorado. He has seen a she wolf and her baby and all he knows about them is that the goddess wants him there to meet them. When he arrives, he sees the woman shift into her wolf form, leaving the infant unprotected.
Leonora was recently bitten by her mate and is forced to shift with the full moon, requiring her to leave Kinzey alone in the forest. She's on the run from a culture that denigrates women and an abusive relationship where she is seen as a possession rather than a person. She made her decision to run and having no support system is a consequence of that choice. But she has very strong protective instincts for her daughter and when she returns to her human form to find a strange alpha male wolf shifter cuddling an unusually calm Kinzey, she's enraged. He refuses to hand Kinzey over, though, and she soon finds they are headed to Arizona, to a pack he says is different. How can she believe him, when what he says goes against everything she's ever experienced?

Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"Kia can start fires without matches. It just happens and there's nothing she can do to stop it, fire is a part of her. She's got fiery red hair and when she gets emotional there are flames she can't control. She was kicked out of school because of a fire she started and is now living with her grandmother, who works on a large estate. Being there brings Kia more questions than answers. She finds out the hard way that the surrounding forest isn't safe. There are creatures she's never seen and they aren't very friendly.

Ethan is used to everything that lurks in the shadows. He knows a lot of terrible secrets and is carrying a heavy burden. He likes Kia from the start, but he knows she isn't safe at the estate. He keeps his distance, but Kia is too smart for him to continue hiding things. He's afraid of what will happen if she finds out the truth, there are sanctions Ethan wouldn't wish on anyone, especially Kia. Will he be able to protect her and does she actually need to be protected?

Red is a great story about an interesting house with a fascinating forest. I loved reading about each creepy creature and like Alyxandra Harvey's vivid imagination. Her main characters are easy to love, which automatically meant I loved the story. Kia is fierce and fabulous and Ethan is responsible and brave. They are opposites who complement each other. Therefore they are a good match and I enjoyed reading about their numerous adventures.

I loved the fact that Kia has fire. It was fun to read about her abilities. She's passionate and the fire shines through in everything she does and it's the base of her personality, which is something that made me smile. Alyxandra Harvey's vivid descriptions of the forest and everything that's lurking there are fabulous. I loved her colorful and creepy monsters and the fact that the story is mostly about what it's like to be both the hunter and the prey. I really enjoyed reading this fast-paced adrenaline-packed story."

Bianca is the young and beautiful dancer who works at the Grand. While working there , she sees a handsome bouncer, whose name is West. She really likes West and would love to get to know him better but thinks she is beneath him, that she is no good for him
One day her mom shows up and tells her that her dad is in trouble, the mob is after him and they needs a lot of $$$$$$ to get him out of it or things will get real bad, real soon. Bianca decides she has no choice but to rob the Grand. Its not like, as she sees it, shes rolling in the money. West, whom she has been slowly talking to, sees she is in trouble and wants to help but knows she won't say a word, keeps wait, watches and hopes she will say something. The attraction, the chemistry between these two are some explosive and electric. Will they or won't they is the question. And will West still want Bianca when all is said and done. Their love story is so beautiful and so full of emotion. There is a lot of pain built into this story. And there is darkness in this story. I loved reading it, feeling it as I read and it kept me on my toes which is Im sure what the characters felt. We see and can feel the human frailties in this story and also can feel the pain yet the hope and that is something Skye Warren does really well. I love how West wants to protect Bianca and does this sweet , alpha man act really well and oh my gawd, it did it soooooooooo well. I want a man like this. Bianca was so worried she would lose him but the ending will show us the HEA. I cannot wait for the next book in the series!

I know that this is a science fiction novel, and that there is an emphasis on a series and a book.  The characters are well developed, and the story line is believable.

Erin is good at tennis, but while she likes it, it doesn't mean everything to her, not the way it does to her mom. Erin's mom is determined that Erin use her talent for tennis, and become something really good, but Erin just wants to have a normal life.

One day whilst visiting her grandmother, Erin finds herself sent back in time to 1970, where she has the chance to play tennis against her mother.
Who will win the match? Is Erin better than her mother? And how will Erin get back to her own time?

This was an okay read, but it felt a little awkward in places.

Erin liked tennis, but not as much as her mother did, and more than anything she wanted to be a normal teenager, and go to the movies with her friends when she wanted to. Erin tried to fit in when she realised that she had travelled back in time, but I expected her to be a lot more concerned with how she was getting back than she was. I personally would have been worried about how I was going to get back, and how soon I would be able to get back rather than making friends in 1970 and taking advantage of how cheap the prices were in the shops!

The storyline was okay, but the time-travel aspect felt a little strange. At the beginning of the story we hear from Erin how annoyed she gets with her mum, and how irritating some boy at school is, and then we're suddenly thrown back in time to 1970. Very sudden, and unexpected, and just didn't fit well with the rest of the story.
The ending was okay, and it was good that Erin learned a little about the sort of person her mom really was. I also liked the fact that Erin's actions in 1970 had consequences, and that her meddling in the past changed things in the present.

Overall; an okay time-travel/coming-of-age story.

Lacey Weston had her reasons for wanting to leave Brisbane where she was attending design school and go back home to Jumbuck Springs.  But when she got home, her brothers wanted her to turn around and go right back.

Cooper Grainger used to be Lacey's bother Ethan's partner and he was asked to keep an eye on Lacey while she was away from home and in school.  She might need someone's help and her brothers wouldn't be there for her.  When Lacey comes to him the night after she breaks up with her boyfriend and says she wants to go home, Coop takes her.

Coop didn't plan on getting caught up in the middle of a family mess, but when he saw them gang up on Lacey, he had to step in.  Lacey had lied about being pregnant so her brothers would let her stay home. When they demanded to know who the father was, Coop said it was him to put an end to the discussion and so they would leave Lacey alone.

Lacey quickly becomes popular in her home town after she reconstructs a damaged wedding gown for a friend and the story makes it in a magazine.  When dream job is presented to Lacey, she can't say no, even if it means leaving her home town and Coop behind and moving to Melbourne.  She has to tell her brothers the truth about not being pregnant so she can take on this new job.  But what will happen to the relationship Lacey and Coop have started during the time they have been living together?

Sometimes you have to let go of who you love so they can be all they are meant to be.

This steamy story is one not to be missed.  Lacey and Coop were meant to be together even though Coop was a lot older than Lacey.  The passion they shared was intense. I can't wait to read the next books in this series."
Kindle_Store_5,5,CG,"I received a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.

The first book in the series, the Bride of the Bride, is the first of the three in the series. It is told from the perspective of a young woman. This book is a great introduction to the story. It is a quick read and will make you feel the emotions of the characters.

The main characters, Cara and Ethan, are on a journey with a group of people who have been close to each other for years. They have been together since they were little. They have a great connection, but have a different way of talking about it. They have a lot of issues, but they are able to overcome them.

This book is about Cara and Ethan. Cara is a single mom, Ethan is a single father who is raising a son in a small town. Cara is a single mom who is dealing with a loss. Ethan is a single father who is dealing with a divorce and a lot of guilt. Cara and Ethan have a connection that is going to be hard for them to forget.

This is a great book. I enjoyed the story and the characters. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a story with a great storyline. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants a fun and sexy read.

Kindle_Store_5,4,OR,"The book for review is Legacy of Fear by Ryshia Kennie. It falls in the genre of mystery with romance tossed in.

The setting is Honk King. Andra, a young woman who now lives here gets the shock of her life when she finds her neighbor across the hall dead. Did they mean to get Andra?

Arriving on the seen is Max, a linguist who is trying to solve a puzzle that has landed in his lap in the form of a doll with the message, Find my heart. Find my girl. Why is he set to locate Andra? He needs her to crack the code of the message and the reason why it was set to him.

This starts off the pair in finding a mythical village that is run by and populated strictly by women. They need to learn a lost language to solve this mystery. Toss in men who are after you at ever turn, the plight of our characters just intensifies.

I do have one part of the book that left me flat. This is not a big book. I get the fact that Max and Andra who start off as friends start to like each other to where they get romantic. While I am not someone who likes reading romance in a book, if it is done in the right amount I am okay with this. The amount of scenes where we saw these characters expressing their feelings for each other and their interludes to me was too much and less would have been just as effective and the point would have been made just as well. I wanted to get on to the mystery and not turn a page and yet again see them being lovey toward each other.

This was a quick read, and you could easily read it in a short time. I loved the story line of the village, language and how it was all tied into a doll that was delivered to Max. That really was fun to read. Overall, this is a good read and for the price you truly cant go wrong."

Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,This is so much fun for the money!  Works great and is hours and hours of fun. I'm getting another one so 5 or more can have a MLP party on rainy summer days.
Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,This was a great gift for my 8 year old grandson.  He had a ball with it and spend quite a bit of time asking it questions!  Kept him busy MUCH longer than I thought it would
Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,"My son said it would be perfect for his 5 year old son's birthdays, my grandson was excited but we know who will be assembling it especially since my son also grew iPad with Legos.  They never disappoint."
Toys_and_Games_5,4,CG,"This is a great set, and has the pieces to make a full castle for a child.  The castle is sturdy enough to hold up to a toddler, and the pieces are very sturdy. "

Toys_and_Games_5,3,CG,"The glow Sticks are great, but the pieces are just too small.

The only downfall is that the top is a bit too small to get the light from inside. I would definitely recommend"

Toys_and_Games_5,5,CG,"Well I definitely got some of the basic pieces, but I will admit that my daughter was pretty disappointed. The game is very simple, and takes a lot of time to get going."
Toys_and_Games_5,3,CG,"While this is a cute little set, the wooden pieces are a little difficult for the kids to grasp.  The pieces are plastic, but they're not plastic, so it's not like they're"

Toys_and_Games_5,4,CG,My 4 year-old girl loves this toy and she has been playing with it for a couple of weeks now. The game is easy to understand and is fun to play.
Toys_and_Games_5,5,CG,Our 6 year old grandson (who is an avid collector of all things Star Wars) was just starting to get into the Star Wars universe.  The basic idea of this toy is pretty simple.
Toys_and_Games_5,3,CG,"Doesn't come with praying mantises, but it's a nice addition.

The only reason I'm giving this a 5 star is because of how small the box is, so it's"
Toys_and_Games_5,4,CG,"Fun figures, good designs, but not a whole lot of fun.

The only reason I gave this a 5 stars is because I am a fan of the game, so it is pretty easy"
Toys_and_Games_5,5,CG,"This along with the chargers and an AC adapter, these are a nice addition to the starter set.

I had to replace the charger and get the battery pack to charge it again.

Toys_and_Games_5,3,CG,Great toy for little guys.  The pieces are sturdy and the pieces fit well in the container.  The only thing I don't like about this toy is the cover.  The cover is a

Toys_and_Games_5,3,OR,"Recipient loved it, a lot. However, what's not so lovable, is the mess. It's also too expensive, in my opinion. As long as you don't mind the price or the inevitable mess of water and glitter everywhere, go for it."
Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,"My son loves it. This has kept my son busy for many, many hours. he loves hammering the nails into the holes and pulling them back out. It is a good product to keep them entertained and developing motor skills."
Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,These are really great little binoculars to use with 2-5 year old kids. We have them in several classrooms at the daycare center that I run. They can stand up to repeated ROUGH use and are a nice bright color.
Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,"I'll be honest. I didn't buy it to build what the box shows. I just wanted the extra bricks to go nuts with my imagination. It's a manageable price, delivered fast, in great condition, and is exactly what I wanted."
Toys_and_Games_5,3,OR,My preschool students had a hard time with the wands.  They didn't really hold the bubble solution.  It was nice to get so many for a reasonable price.  Used when teaching about things blowing in the wind.

They're both are NOT related; however, both are a best gift toys!"
Toys_and_Games_5,2,OR,"Bought 2 of these for my Blade Nano Fpv quad to see if they were as great as advertised.  One powered it for 3:30, the other wouldn't make it to 3:00.  I've had cheaper batteries that performed better."
Toys_and_Games_5,4,OR,These tools are well constructed.  They have wood handles and metal ends.  The metal is held on to the handle with a screw so they should hold up well to many hours of toddler use in the garden.
Toys_and_Games_5,4,OR,My 6 year-old daughter wanted to be a chicken for Halloween. Okay...... I found this costume and it is pretty good quality. She now wears it for dress-up. It makes all of us laugh. I am glad we got it.
Toys_and_Games_5,2,OR,"Unbelievable! This was such a rare car, and I thought it would be cool. But no, soon after I bought it, the tow cable came off, and the paint on the windshield got scratched off. Not recommending this to anybody!!"
Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,"We love Playmobil, especially the products that remind us of real life, like this playground (if only our local one had a dinosaur to play on, though!).  I love that there's even a cute little bench for the mommy."
Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,"Warning, very, very small pieces. This is a wonderful little playset and we are major fans of the Magiclip princesses. My three year old changes their clothes with zero problem and loves their little 'houses'."
Toys_and_Games_5,4,OR,"The fit is a little off. It doesn't stay on my 6 year olds head unless she uses the mittens or we tie it like a scarf. Other then that, she's in love with it. So, I like it too."
Toys_and_Games_5,4,OR,Great toy for the beginner user of remote controls. However it does have limited movements. Also be sure to turn off when not in use because it will kill the batteries in between uses. All in all a good buy.
Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,We have purchased many of Melissa and Doug products before. I like how they not only teach but also entertain. I bought this for my niece but my four year old nephew also loves helping his sister stack them up.
Toys_and_Games_5,1,OR,"Too small for anything useful.  I wanted to use one to cover the camera on my computers but they're too small! I'm sorry I bought them, but since they were so cheap,  I won't bother to return them."
Toys_and_Games_5,3,OR,Elmo is adorable and my baby loves it but it sheds like crazy. There is little red fur everywhere. All you have to do is touch it and it loses fur. This thing is gonna be bald in a month
Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,This really was a great find for a girl who loves  Barbie. The accessories alone that are included are well worth the price and we had no issues with the mechanics of the vending machine. Would buy again definitely!

Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,"just like in Disney world but much cheaper, and trust me the whole family was entertained when I used the toy and pretended to make it talk (great way to spend the hours waiting in line for rides) fun fun times"
Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,"It's like the Zombiestrike Sword, only shorter.  But hey, it's a miniature Katana (kuh-tuh-naw).  How cool is that?  Is it worth the dollar increase over the Zombiestrike sword?  Probably not, but to some, having variation is everything."
Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,"These are great, but understand they're toy soldiers for fantasy nerds.  As long as you don't expect more than you would from their green and tan counterparts, you will be pleased.  Actually, the quality is quite a bit higher."
Toys_and_Games_5,4,OR,"My only complaint about this set is that is constantly falls apart at the hinge.  Even though I have to reassemble it regularly, my 4-year-old loves it and has spent quite a bit of time playing with it since Christmas."
Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,"Great floor puzzle, vibrant colors and large floor size pieces.  I love that the pieces easily fit together and lay flat.  Nothing is more frustrating for kiddos then when the pieces won't lay flat!!  Would certainly purchase again."
Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,"I can stuff several dolls and a handful of accessories in here. It's been great for trips and other times when our daughter wanted to take her dolls with her. The chain handle broke, but the box has held up decently."
Toys_and_Games_5,1,OR,"This toy would benefit greatly from an on/off switch.  My 9 mo old seems mildly entertained by it, but you can't turn it off, you can't put it away. I think I'm going to have to get rid of it."
Toys_and_Games_5,4,OR,"For the price, this is a good deal. It's a very small box. Probably the size of a mini puzzle box. Definitely not worth the 16.00 it's listed for right now. I paid $8.00 for it and that's a decent price."
Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,"I had doubts with this set but purchased it based on the other reviews being positive.  I am so happy I did get this, it works great!  The darts actually stick and this is a fun set for kids."
Toys_and_Games_5,4,OR,I purchased this because we use it for sensory play with my son.  He has just recently started experimenting with PlayDoh.  It seems like it isn't the quality of what I grew up with but still a good product.
Toys_and_Games_5,3,OR,"Super cute dolls however the arms/hands come off rather easy.  They are supposed to, as in Monster High School doll style, but these are way too easy to pull off.  We lost an arm within an hour of play."
Toys_and_Games_5,4,OR,"I wish the music played continually instead of turning off after one song as my son hasn't mastered hitting the button for another song. Regardless, its a good distraction in the car for him and the two volume settings are nice"
