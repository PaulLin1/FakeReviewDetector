Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,OR,The smokes don't fit in the grooves.  It's as if the plastic cooled to much and shrunk when manufacturing.  Had to smash the ciggs to get them to fit instead of them going in effortlessly.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Nice and sturdy, and the size and shape comes in handy when a 1-cup is too small.  Easy to read markings.  Haven't used the strainer yet, but it may come in handy down the road."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"This is a great heater for bedrooms or other small to medium rooms.  Shuts off when it reaches the desired temp.  The listed temp may not be exact, but you can adjust to your comfort."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Please note that this is for the single large 3d skull, not the smaller multiple 3d skull mounds. I use this huge one to make sugar skulls, it is sturdy and great for chocolate and sugar sculpture."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,OR,I thought this would be a perfect keep at work filtered water solution yet the space the filter takes up makes this somewhat clunky tumbler's capacity limited to 26 oz and as such need of frequent refilling.
